00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,090
This course has broken down into multiple sections.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,350
We'll first learn how to navigate around the interface and in the next section will begin setting up

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,730
our project.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,230
Next we will be adding content into our artworks and then we'll complete the design using the skills

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,680
that we've learned in previous sections after the design is complete.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,030
We'll move on to prototyping and sharing our design and I'll lead off with some resources that you can

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,020
use to continue learning and designing with Figma.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,850
This course is designed to walk you through designing your recipe from scratch.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,430
But if you ever want to jump into future videos and of course there are exercise files included to start

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,330
wherever you'd like.
