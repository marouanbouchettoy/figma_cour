This course has broken down into multiple sections.

1
00:03.300 --> 00:07.350
We'll first learn how to navigate around the interface and in the next section will begin setting up

2
00:07.350 --> 00:08.730
our project.

3
00:08.730 --> 00:13.230
Next we will be adding content into our artworks and then we'll complete the design using the skills

4
00:13.230 --> 00:16.680
that we've learned in previous sections after the design is complete.

5
00:16.680 --> 00:21.030
We'll move on to prototyping and sharing our design and I'll lead off with some resources that you can

6
00:21.030 --> 00:24.020
use to continue learning and designing with Figma.

7
00:24.180 --> 00:27.850
This course is designed to walk you through designing your recipe from scratch.

8
00:27.940 --> 00:32.430
But if you ever want to jump into future videos and of course there are exercise files included to start

9
00:32.430 --> 00:33.330
wherever you'd like.
