00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,430
As we go through the videos in this course I may introduce certain files that we want to start out with

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,170
and you can download these exercise files in Udemy. if you're watching this in Udemy, you can

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,900
click this menu button to open up the coarse sections and this is where you will download the exercise

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,690
files to follow along.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,550
This is what the exercise files folder looks like.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,640
And you can see to the very left we have an assets folder.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,410
If we double click inside of here this is where we're going to see all of our images and text files.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,400
And these are things that we're going to import into our projects.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,050
But if you're following along in specific chapters I may introduce a new file at the beginning of the

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,040
video in the bottom left corner.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,890
And if you follow that path you can click inside of the folder and this is where the files are going

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,660
to live.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,770
If you want to start off with the same file I'm using in the video.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,730
Now once we begin designing the recipe app you will be able to start your own file and follow along

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,460
with me without having to download each file for each video.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,090
If you do skip some videos However I recommend that you start with the latest file inside of one of

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,310
these folders as you work through the design with me in the video.
