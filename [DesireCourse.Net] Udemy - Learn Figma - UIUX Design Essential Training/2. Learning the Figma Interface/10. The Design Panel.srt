1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,630
To show you the design panel I have a simple art board here with a few elements on them and this design

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,370
panel will change depending on what you have clicked on.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,030
So here we have a basic home screen for our recipe Web site.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,530
And when we don't have anything selected this design panel reflects the canvas or the background that

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,240
the frames are sitting on.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,230
So here we can change the color of this background if we want it to be more dark for example or if we

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,460
want the background to show in some exports and we can also change the transparency and choose to enable

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,290
pixel preview or pixel grid preview right here.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,870
So all of our design properties are around the background here because we don't have anything selected.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,760
So when we select this chef's hat we can see the properties changed to reflect this hat so we can still

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,660
move this around and we can move the x and y coordinates here.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,220
And you see the properties panel is changing.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,900
And we can also resize the width and the height and we can lock the proportions.

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:14,320
So if I want to change the height here to be 30 then the width is going to change to reflect that ratio.

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,160
You can also quickly change the rotation by 15 degrees.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,440
And also if you hold down command while you're hovering over these anchor points you can rotate them

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,790
with your mouse as well.

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,980
Now one really nice feature and Figment are the constraints tools with these tools we can constrain

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:43,850
any objects to the left on top of this our border frame or we can pin it to the right or the center.

20
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,040
So we have all of these controls to constrain our objects for responsive design.

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,340
For example this one if I choose to scale this I'm going to click on this desktop frame now and I'm

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,150
just going to resize this and you can see that both of these items scale here.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,970
Now I'm going to hold down Kamensky and undo that.

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,550
We don't want this to scale what we wanted to do is pinned to the top left here.

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,450
This one compared to the top left and maybe these guys here can pinned to the top right.

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,020
So we have those set up and now and we rescale this.

27
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,540
You can see up the top here that behaves how it's supposed to.

28
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,250
So as you can see there's very nice controls here for constraints.

29
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,200
And then we have a layer section and this is where we can get some overlay settings if we want something

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
to multiply.

31
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,310
So why it multiplied by anything is that color changes to red you can kind of see how it's transparent.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm going to hold out command here and zoom in so you can kind of see what that's doing.

33
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,110
But you can play with some different overlay effects here and get a nice style that you want.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm just going to change this back to white and just normal is fine.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,560
So you have some nice opacity effects here you can increase the transparency here or just simply hide

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,070
the layer if you want to.

37
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,250
And then you have full control so this is where you'll change the actual color and we saw that as I

38
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,310
was changing this around so you can change this to blue and we can create a feel on top of a feel which

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,390
is really great.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,860
So if I click on the plus icon here you can see that I have a linear feel on top of a solid feel so

41
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,960
that gives us this nice white on top of blue and I can change the angle of these pretty quickly.

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,590
And just get a nice effect if I want something like that looks good.

43
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,390
And so multiple fill options.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:47,000
And within this fill color you can fill with the solid color a linear color radial angular diamond or

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,290
an actual image.

46
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,400
So if you click on image here that's going to ask you to choose an image and you can find one in your

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
file and fill that image.

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,160
If I ever want to delete a feel I can just click on the file here and just click this subtract button

49
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,530
and then I'll remove that.

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,710
And now I'll turn this back to white.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,430
And we have stroke.

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,280
And again we can create multiple stroke colors.

53
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,990
I'll just create this as blue and I want this to be on the outside of the icon and you can change the

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,680
weight you have some nice dash settings if you want that stroke to be dashed if you want the dashes

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,710
to be kept things like that.

56
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,000
Now we also have some effects settings and I'm going to show you if I hold down a command and just scroll

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,600
down or zoom out here and you can see this background here.

58
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,050
We actually have two effects here.

59
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,600
So when you click on the plus icon it adds a new effect.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,200
And here I'm going to just delete this one and then you can choose between an inner shadow drop shadow

61
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,610
layer Blar or background blur.

62
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:02,000
Now this background blur is really nice because you have the ability to turn down the opacity and when

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,820
to turn this to 70 here so we can kind of see what's going on in the background.

64
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,720
And you can see this layer is blurred the background and these settings can be changed right here.

65
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,920
So I can decide I want this to be a 30 pixel Blar and you can see it's becoming more blurred.

66
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,500
And then just turn the opacity however you want to see that blur in the background.

67
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,010
Maybe I'll turn this to 90 and same thing with drop shadow.

68
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,720
Just click this icon to see the blur settings and if you want a y coordinate here if you want to draw

69
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,990
the shutter down to pixels that will happen here.

70
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,980
And you can change the opacity here and also some overlay effects for that shadow itself.

71
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,180
So very powerful controls just for basic shapes like these icons or these rectangles.

72
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,450
You can also see this rectangle shape.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,330
I've actually removed the feel.

74
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,540
So if it starts out with the feel you can just click over here and click the subtract icon and I'll

75
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,630
remove that fill.

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,820
And now I only have a stroke and with this stroke I've actually created a dashed line here so you can

77
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,860
see that here there's a two pixel dash and a 2 pixel gap.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,950
And if I click away you can kind of see that Dashon gap here.

79
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,780
So with the chef's icon with this rectangle and these icons we get the same kind of design panel here

80
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,690
that's meant for vector shapes but now when I click on this background here and we can see although

81
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,840
this looks like an image it's actually a rectangle with an image feel applied.

82
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:44,580
So we have this image fill here and then we have a black 20 percent opacity layer feel on top of that.

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,580
And then we have a linear feel just for the top.

84
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,380
Just to give a little black transition down so this text is easier to read here.

85
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,710
So this is all one object and it has three different layers and makes it very nice to quickly go in

86
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,870
and change some of these.

87
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,930
So let's say maybe I only want a 5 percent opacity here we can change that very easily.

88
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,740
And if I want to edit this image at all I can click on this little thumbnail and I have some nice exposure

89
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,710
controls if I want to change the exposure some contrast change that here and we can change the temperature

90
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,860
if we want it to be warmer colder.

91
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,890
You can do that very easily and then we have other controls like tint highlights and shadows now one

92
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,180
thing I haven't shown you yet are the alignments and the distribution tools.

93
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,220
So if I click on this like on here and let's just mess this up a little bit just drag these around here

94
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,870
if I want these to be aligned I can hold down shift and just select the multiple items here.

95
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,920
And I have some alignment controls up here to align things to the top line into the bottom.

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,770
Now these are the same height so top and bottom are both aligned or aligned center.

97
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,830
And then we also have distribute a horizontal spacing which will make sure that this has the same spacing

98
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,330
between each icon.

99
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,140
So if I want it I can click on these icons just align them to this text here.

100
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:20,990
And do that to start out with and then hold down shift and select these different objects and will distribute

101
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,440
these evenly will align them evenly.

102
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,320
And now we can move this text to be aligned with this object itself.

103
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,000
So very nice to just have a clean design here.

104
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,870
And now with different text layers you can see we have some of the similar properties like constraints.

105
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,100
We can resize here very easily but now we have a text section and this is where you going to change

106
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,180
your font styles your weights and the sizes.

107
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,260
And if it's multiple lines of text like we see here down below we can change things like the line spacing.

108
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,910
I'm going to change this to 120 percent and you can see how that spacing increases here.

109
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,070
Also the spacing between characters so if you want to increase that by 15 percent we can do that and

110
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,920
maybe I'll just do 5 percent because that was a bit dramatic and also paragraph spacing so if you want

111
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,310
to change this to 20 you can see only the paragraph was spaced.

112
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,350
Now we can align this text to the top of the bounding box the center of the bounding box or the bottom

113
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,390
of the bounding box.

114
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:35,030
So now if we change this bounding box to be taller we can change where that lives inside of this box.

115
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,640
We also have paragraph indentation and some alignment tools that you find in common text editors.

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,140
But there are some hidden effects here as well.

117
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,280
So if we drag this down here and we click on this advanced menu we have things like auto resize the

118
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,990
width and you can see what that did here it made it as wide as the text allows.

119
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:06,020
I'm going to hit undo and we have some other objects like transform this to all upper case or lower

120
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,740
case or just correct capitalization.

121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,040
And then we have some underline or strikethrough effects here.

122
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,230
Makes it very handy.

123
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,470
And then we have some more advanced font features like Fraction's all smallcaps superscript or subscript.

124
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,890
And then we can change the way fonts are lined by proportional alignments tabular proportional style

125
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,490
or tapping their old style so a lot of great advanced features for fonts as well as the normal stroke

126
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:41,510
effects layers and constraints sections that you get with other objects.

127
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,980
Now there's one more section we haven't talked about here and that's the export section and this is

128
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,590
with every object that you select.

129
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,250
You have the ability to export that object.

130
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:56,240
So we have three icons here and let's say you want to export this out as we develop for the iPhone.

131
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,340
Well we can click on this plus export and we can see that this is going to export as a one time PMG

132
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,990
and we can change this to JPEG or SPG.

133
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,540
But if we only want peahen G We can click plus a few times to even export this out as two times resolution

134
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,200
three times resolution and get multiple file sizes with just one export of this spoon.

135
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,450
Same thing with this fork.

136
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,790
Just click this one to three and you have three different sizes that are going to be exported and this

137
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,110
knife.

138
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,530
One two three.

139
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:38,730
So with this we can quickly quick preview and see how this is going to look in the preview and then

140
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,730
export this file into any folder that you want.

141
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,220
Now because I set these to be exportable if I ever change them and then export it'll actually export

142
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,840
the changes and I can click on this tool here to export in bulk all of the items I've already set previously

143
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,670
to be exportable.

144
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,960
They'll all be here so I can do a one time export of everything in my project.
