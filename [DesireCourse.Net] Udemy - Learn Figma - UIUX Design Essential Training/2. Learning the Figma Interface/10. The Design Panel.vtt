00:00.360 --> 00:06.630
To show you the design panel I have a simple art board here with a few elements on them and this design

00:06.630 --> 00:10.370
panel will change depending on what you have clicked on.

00:10.380 --> 00:14.030
So here we have a basic home screen for our recipe Web site.

00:14.190 --> 00:19.530
And when we don't have anything selected this design panel reflects the canvas or the background that

00:19.530 --> 00:21.240
the frames are sitting on.

00:21.240 --> 00:28.230
So here we can change the color of this background if we want it to be more dark for example or if we

00:28.230 --> 00:35.460
want the background to show in some exports and we can also change the transparency and choose to enable

00:35.460 --> 00:40.290
pixel preview or pixel grid preview right here.

00:40.470 --> 00:46.870
So all of our design properties are around the background here because we don't have anything selected.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.760
So when we select this chef's hat we can see the properties changed to reflect this hat so we can still

00:53.760 --> 00:57.660
move this around and we can move the x and y coordinates here.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.220
And you see the properties panel is changing.

01:00.690 --> 01:05.900
And we can also resize the width and the height and we can lock the proportions.

01:06.060 --> 01:14.320
So if I want to change the height here to be 30 then the width is going to change to reflect that ratio.

01:15.210 --> 01:19.160
You can also quickly change the rotation by 15 degrees.

01:19.320 --> 01:25.440
And also if you hold down command while you're hovering over these anchor points you can rotate them

01:25.440 --> 01:26.790
with your mouse as well.

01:27.620 --> 01:33.980
Now one really nice feature and Figment are the constraints tools with these tools we can constrain

01:33.980 --> 01:43.850
any objects to the left on top of this our border frame or we can pin it to the right or the center.

01:44.030 --> 01:49.040
So we have all of these controls to constrain our objects for responsive design.

01:49.740 --> 01:58.340
For example this one if I choose to scale this I'm going to click on this desktop frame now and I'm

01:58.340 --> 02:03.150
just going to resize this and you can see that both of these items scale here.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.970
Now I'm going to hold down Kamensky and undo that.

02:06.020 --> 02:11.550
We don't want this to scale what we wanted to do is pinned to the top left here.

02:11.660 --> 02:16.450
This one compared to the top left and maybe these guys here can pinned to the top right.

02:16.940 --> 02:21.020
So we have those set up and now and we rescale this.

02:21.020 --> 02:24.540
You can see up the top here that behaves how it's supposed to.

02:24.710 --> 02:28.250
So as you can see there's very nice controls here for constraints.

02:28.250 --> 02:33.200
And then we have a layer section and this is where we can get some overlay settings if we want something

02:33.200 --> 02:34.320
to multiply.

02:34.610 --> 02:41.310
So why it multiplied by anything is that color changes to red you can kind of see how it's transparent.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.800
I'm going to hold out command here and zoom in so you can kind of see what that's doing.

02:44.990 --> 02:50.110
But you can play with some different overlay effects here and get a nice style that you want.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.140
I'm just going to change this back to white and just normal is fine.

02:54.440 --> 03:00.560
So you have some nice opacity effects here you can increase the transparency here or just simply hide

03:00.560 --> 03:02.070
the layer if you want to.

03:02.420 --> 03:07.250
And then you have full control so this is where you'll change the actual color and we saw that as I

03:07.250 --> 03:13.310
was changing this around so you can change this to blue and we can create a feel on top of a feel which

03:13.310 --> 03:14.390
is really great.

03:14.420 --> 03:21.860
So if I click on the plus icon here you can see that I have a linear feel on top of a solid feel so

03:21.860 --> 03:28.960
that gives us this nice white on top of blue and I can change the angle of these pretty quickly.

03:30.340 --> 03:34.590
And just get a nice effect if I want something like that looks good.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.390
And so multiple fill options.

03:38.600 --> 03:47.000
And within this fill color you can fill with the solid color a linear color radial angular diamond or

03:47.000 --> 03:48.290
an actual image.

03:48.290 --> 03:52.400
So if you click on image here that's going to ask you to choose an image and you can find one in your

03:52.400 --> 03:55.000
file and fill that image.

03:55.040 --> 04:01.160
If I ever want to delete a feel I can just click on the file here and just click this subtract button

04:01.190 --> 04:02.530
and then I'll remove that.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.710
And now I'll turn this back to white.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.430
And we have stroke.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.280
And again we can create multiple stroke colors.

04:11.340 --> 04:18.990
I'll just create this as blue and I want this to be on the outside of the icon and you can change the

04:19.000 --> 04:25.680
weight you have some nice dash settings if you want that stroke to be dashed if you want the dashes

04:25.680 --> 04:27.710
to be kept things like that.

04:29.210 --> 04:35.000
Now we also have some effects settings and I'm going to show you if I hold down a command and just scroll

04:35.000 --> 04:39.600
down or zoom out here and you can see this background here.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.050
We actually have two effects here.

04:42.110 --> 04:45.600
So when you click on the plus icon it adds a new effect.

04:45.600 --> 04:51.200
And here I'm going to just delete this one and then you can choose between an inner shadow drop shadow

04:51.290 --> 04:53.610
layer Blar or background blur.

04:53.780 --> 05:02.000
Now this background blur is really nice because you have the ability to turn down the opacity and when

05:02.040 --> 05:05.820
to turn this to 70 here so we can kind of see what's going on in the background.

05:05.930 --> 05:11.720
And you can see this layer is blurred the background and these settings can be changed right here.

05:11.720 --> 05:17.920
So I can decide I want this to be a 30 pixel Blar and you can see it's becoming more blurred.

05:18.170 --> 05:23.500
And then just turn the opacity however you want to see that blur in the background.

05:24.670 --> 05:29.010
Maybe I'll turn this to 90 and same thing with drop shadow.

05:29.010 --> 05:34.720
Just click this icon to see the blur settings and if you want a y coordinate here if you want to draw

05:34.770 --> 05:37.990
the shutter down to pixels that will happen here.

05:38.790 --> 05:45.980
And you can change the opacity here and also some overlay effects for that shadow itself.

05:46.140 --> 05:52.180
So very powerful controls just for basic shapes like these icons or these rectangles.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.450
You can also see this rectangle shape.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.330
I've actually removed the feel.

05:56.430 --> 06:01.540
So if it starts out with the feel you can just click over here and click the subtract icon and I'll

06:01.590 --> 06:02.630
remove that fill.

06:02.640 --> 06:08.820
And now I only have a stroke and with this stroke I've actually created a dashed line here so you can

06:08.820 --> 06:13.860
see that here there's a two pixel dash and a 2 pixel gap.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.950
And if I click away you can kind of see that Dashon gap here.

06:18.970 --> 06:25.780
So with the chef's icon with this rectangle and these icons we get the same kind of design panel here

06:26.100 --> 06:31.690
that's meant for vector shapes but now when I click on this background here and we can see although

06:31.690 --> 06:35.840
this looks like an image it's actually a rectangle with an image feel applied.

06:36.220 --> 06:44.580
So we have this image fill here and then we have a black 20 percent opacity layer feel on top of that.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.580
And then we have a linear feel just for the top.

06:48.580 --> 06:53.380
Just to give a little black transition down so this text is easier to read here.

06:53.410 --> 06:59.710
So this is all one object and it has three different layers and makes it very nice to quickly go in

06:59.710 --> 07:01.870
and change some of these.

07:01.870 --> 07:07.930
So let's say maybe I only want a 5 percent opacity here we can change that very easily.

07:08.530 --> 07:14.740
And if I want to edit this image at all I can click on this little thumbnail and I have some nice exposure

07:14.740 --> 07:21.710
controls if I want to change the exposure some contrast change that here and we can change the temperature

07:21.710 --> 07:23.860
if we want it to be warmer colder.

07:24.660 --> 07:31.890
You can do that very easily and then we have other controls like tint highlights and shadows now one

07:31.890 --> 07:36.180
thing I haven't shown you yet are the alignments and the distribution tools.

07:36.180 --> 07:41.220
So if I click on this like on here and let's just mess this up a little bit just drag these around here

07:41.640 --> 07:46.870
if I want these to be aligned I can hold down shift and just select the multiple items here.

07:47.340 --> 07:52.920
And I have some alignment controls up here to align things to the top line into the bottom.

07:52.920 --> 07:58.770
Now these are the same height so top and bottom are both aligned or aligned center.

07:58.770 --> 08:04.830
And then we also have distribute a horizontal spacing which will make sure that this has the same spacing

08:04.830 --> 08:06.330
between each icon.

08:06.330 --> 08:11.140
So if I want it I can click on these icons just align them to this text here.

08:14.030 --> 08:20.990
And do that to start out with and then hold down shift and select these different objects and will distribute

08:20.990 --> 08:23.440
these evenly will align them evenly.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.320
And now we can move this text to be aligned with this object itself.

08:29.980 --> 08:33.000
So very nice to just have a clean design here.

08:34.500 --> 08:40.870
And now with different text layers you can see we have some of the similar properties like constraints.

08:40.920 --> 08:47.100
We can resize here very easily but now we have a text section and this is where you going to change

08:47.100 --> 08:51.180
your font styles your weights and the sizes.

08:51.180 --> 08:57.260
And if it's multiple lines of text like we see here down below we can change things like the line spacing.

08:57.260 --> 09:01.910
I'm going to change this to 120 percent and you can see how that spacing increases here.

09:02.220 --> 09:08.070
Also the spacing between characters so if you want to increase that by 15 percent we can do that and

09:08.070 --> 09:13.920
maybe I'll just do 5 percent because that was a bit dramatic and also paragraph spacing so if you want

09:13.920 --> 09:20.310
to change this to 20 you can see only the paragraph was spaced.

09:20.370 --> 09:25.350
Now we can align this text to the top of the bounding box the center of the bounding box or the bottom

09:25.350 --> 09:27.390
of the bounding box.

09:27.390 --> 09:35.030
So now if we change this bounding box to be taller we can change where that lives inside of this box.

09:37.260 --> 09:43.640
We also have paragraph indentation and some alignment tools that you find in common text editors.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.140
But there are some hidden effects here as well.

09:46.170 --> 09:53.280
So if we drag this down here and we click on this advanced menu we have things like auto resize the

09:53.280 --> 09:57.990
width and you can see what that did here it made it as wide as the text allows.

09:57.990 --> 10:06.020
I'm going to hit undo and we have some other objects like transform this to all upper case or lower

10:06.020 --> 10:09.740
case or just correct capitalization.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.040
And then we have some underline or strikethrough effects here.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.230
Makes it very handy.

10:14.240 --> 10:21.470
And then we have some more advanced font features like Fraction's all smallcaps superscript or subscript.

10:21.470 --> 10:27.890
And then we can change the way fonts are lined by proportional alignments tabular proportional style

10:27.890 --> 10:34.490
or tapping their old style so a lot of great advanced features for fonts as well as the normal stroke

10:34.580 --> 10:41.510
effects layers and constraints sections that you get with other objects.

10:41.510 --> 10:45.980
Now there's one more section we haven't talked about here and that's the export section and this is

10:45.980 --> 10:47.590
with every object that you select.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.250
You have the ability to export that object.

10:50.330 --> 10:56.240
So we have three icons here and let's say you want to export this out as we develop for the iPhone.

10:56.480 --> 11:03.340
Well we can click on this plus export and we can see that this is going to export as a one time PMG

11:03.980 --> 11:06.990
and we can change this to JPEG or SPG.

11:07.280 --> 11:14.540
But if we only want peahen G We can click plus a few times to even export this out as two times resolution

11:14.690 --> 11:22.200
three times resolution and get multiple file sizes with just one export of this spoon.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.450
Same thing with this fork.

11:23.450 --> 11:28.790
Just click this one to three and you have three different sizes that are going to be exported and this

11:28.790 --> 11:29.110
knife.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.530
One two three.

11:30.530 --> 11:38.730
So with this we can quickly quick preview and see how this is going to look in the preview and then

11:38.760 --> 11:41.730
export this file into any folder that you want.

11:41.940 --> 11:47.220
Now because I set these to be exportable if I ever change them and then export it'll actually export

11:47.220 --> 11:54.840
the changes and I can click on this tool here to export in bulk all of the items I've already set previously

11:55.230 --> 11:56.670
to be exportable.

11:56.670 --> 12:00.960
They'll all be here so I can do a one time export of everything in my project.
