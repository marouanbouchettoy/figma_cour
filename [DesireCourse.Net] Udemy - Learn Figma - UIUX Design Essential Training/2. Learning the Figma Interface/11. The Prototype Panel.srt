1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,190
The prototype panel is where are you going to go to connect all of your art boards for an interactive

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,680
prototype and that lives right next to this design tap here so I'm going to click on this prototype

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,200
tab and it's first going to ask what you want the background to be when you're in prototype mode and

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,980
to jump into prototype mode you click on this present icon and it opens up a new tab and this tab will

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,190
show you what this prototype is going to look like and I can jump into this tab here to link up this

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,670
prototype and I can toggle between these two tabs to see my prototype or my design.

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,930
So it's very simple to link up a prototype.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,600
We can see if I scroll here to the left a little bit and I click on this log and page here there's a

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,950
circle here this new to this bounding box.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,760
And I can click and drag on this circle to present a wire that I can bring to any other art board and

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
link up.

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:00,210
Now instead of doing that I can also just click on the log in button itself and I'll double click inside

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,490
of here and we can see the same circle.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,740
So this log in button I want to go to the home page.

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,430
And so just watch how quickly I can link up this prototype here.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,280
Here's the hamburger menu.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,180
I'm going to double click into there and that will open up this page and if I zoom in a little bit I

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,230
can quickly link up these menu items so I can double click into exhibitions in advance if I want to

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,350
link up the shopping the collections.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,240
And I think we have tickets.

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,490
That's plan your visit and one more is the membership.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,140
So become a member.

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,620
So now those are all linked up.

24
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:55,020
And if I double click inside of here we can link all of these back into this menu icon

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,810
and now I can choose to have this area go back to this art board here or let me change this and change

26
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,250
it to go back to this art form.

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,010
So we should have everything linked up and we can see here there's this little home icon saying this

28
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,540
is where your prototype is going to first land.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,620
So I can click on this and I can bring this in the other place that I want and that's how this prototype

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,520
panel does for you as it just enables you to have quick access as to why are these art boards up then

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,690
you can click on this play icon which is right here.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,480
It'll tab back over here and then you can interact with a prototype opening the menu item going to exhibitions

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,220
go into your collections and just jump through your prototype very easily using the tools in the prototype

34
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,760
panel.
