The prototype panel is where are you going to go to connect all of your art boards for an interactive

00:05.190 --> 00:10.680
prototype and that lives right next to this design tap here so I'm going to click on this prototype

00:10.680 --> 00:16.200
tab and it's first going to ask what you want the background to be when you're in prototype mode and

00:16.200 --> 00:22.980
to jump into prototype mode you click on this present icon and it opens up a new tab and this tab will

00:22.980 --> 00:29.190
show you what this prototype is going to look like and I can jump into this tab here to link up this

00:29.190 --> 00:34.670
prototype and I can toggle between these two tabs to see my prototype or my design.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.930
So it's very simple to link up a prototype.

00:37.990 --> 00:42.600
We can see if I scroll here to the left a little bit and I click on this log and page here there's a

00:42.600 --> 00:44.950
circle here this new to this bounding box.

00:45.030 --> 00:50.760
And I can click and drag on this circle to present a wire that I can bring to any other art board and

00:50.760 --> 00:52.800
link up.

00:52.830 --> 01:00.210
Now instead of doing that I can also just click on the log in button itself and I'll double click inside

01:00.210 --> 01:02.490
of here and we can see the same circle.

01:02.490 --> 01:05.740
So this log in button I want to go to the home page.

01:06.330 --> 01:10.430
And so just watch how quickly I can link up this prototype here.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.280
Here's the hamburger menu.

01:12.450 --> 01:20.180
I'm going to double click into there and that will open up this page and if I zoom in a little bit I

01:20.180 --> 01:27.230
can quickly link up these menu items so I can double click into exhibitions in advance if I want to

01:27.320 --> 01:32.350
link up the shopping the collections.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.240
And I think we have tickets.

01:35.300 --> 01:40.490
That's plan your visit and one more is the membership.

01:40.930 --> 01:44.140
So become a member.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.620
So now those are all linked up.

01:46.850 --> 01:55.020
And if I double click inside of here we can link all of these back into this menu icon

02:03.520 --> 02:12.810
and now I can choose to have this area go back to this art board here or let me change this and change

02:12.810 --> 02:14.250
it to go back to this art form.

02:17.730 --> 02:23.010
So we should have everything linked up and we can see here there's this little home icon saying this

02:23.010 --> 02:25.540
is where your prototype is going to first land.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.620
So I can click on this and I can bring this in the other place that I want and that's how this prototype

02:31.800 --> 02:38.520
panel does for you as it just enables you to have quick access as to why are these art boards up then

02:38.520 --> 02:41.690
you can click on this play icon which is right here.

02:41.800 --> 02:48.480
It'll tab back over here and then you can interact with a prototype opening the menu item going to exhibitions

02:49.080 --> 02:56.220
go into your collections and just jump through your prototype very easily using the tools in the prototype

02:56.310 --> 02:56.760
panel.
