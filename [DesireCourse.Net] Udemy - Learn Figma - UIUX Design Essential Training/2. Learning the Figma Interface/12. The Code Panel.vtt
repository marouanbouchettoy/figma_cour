It you still have the previous file open from the last video we can continue along.

00:04.170 --> 00:07.140
And if not just open up the prototype panel file.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.350
In the chapter two exercise Files folder.

00:10.350 --> 00:15.840
Now we're using the same file just to illustrate the coding panel and what happens in here.

00:15.870 --> 00:21.990
So because we don't have anything selected we have the background and is telling us the hex value here

00:21.990 --> 00:24.700
for the background of this canvas.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.900
And so you can see very quickly if you were to be programming in CSSA.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.800
You can grab some quick code to Plaisance your design files.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.390
And same with iOS.

00:34.590 --> 00:40.460
You have this R-GA background color or Android so you can quickly change that.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.420
Or if you want to click on this code this gives you the CSSA properties.

00:45.450 --> 00:50.520
So now you have background colon and then the color and you can quickly copy that and paste that into

00:50.520 --> 00:51.890
your development project.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.960
So that's simple enough for the background.

00:55.060 --> 00:59.860
But now if we click on some of these other elements here I'm going to hold down Z and just zoom into

00:59.860 --> 01:06.900
this log in page and let's double click on this logon button here so we can see very quickly.

01:06.910 --> 01:13.380
We have the width height and then left and top padding here so very easily we can click and select this.

01:13.390 --> 01:16.220
Paste this into our CSSA files.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.890
Same thing with iOS or Android.

01:18.890 --> 01:26.730
And we can get some table views here or the code view and this really can happen with almost any object.

01:26.740 --> 01:28.520
Here we have this pin drop.

01:28.520 --> 01:35.530
When I do the same thing and because this is SPG it kind of gives you this view where you can copy and

01:35.530 --> 01:45.010
paste this and with the images again you have the position in the high left right and it'll give you

01:45.010 --> 01:46.890
the file name of that image.

01:46.900 --> 01:53.020
So if you're designing anything in Sigma 2 then code later or if you want to give your design files

01:53.020 --> 01:59.830
to your developers make them aware of this code panel because it'll likely save them a lot of time trying

01:59.830 --> 02:06.700
to get certain colors or different font styles by just jumping in here grabbing these and applying them

02:06.700 --> 02:08.380
to their code.

02:08.380 --> 02:14.800
Now I do get a lot of questions about Sigma being able to convert your whole design into code and although

02:14.800 --> 02:20.640
it doesn't do that as far as the entire design being placed into code and structure it.

02:21.040 --> 02:29.050
This is still really nice for developers to take these little snippets of code or information and code

02:29.080 --> 02:31.040
and structure the code themselves.
