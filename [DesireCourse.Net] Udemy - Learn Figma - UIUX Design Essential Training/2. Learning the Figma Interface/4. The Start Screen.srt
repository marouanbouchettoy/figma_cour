1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,470
Now they were signed up for figment we can see the start screen here and this is where we get access

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,830
to all of our files.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,620
So we have three sample files that figure has given us and we can always double click into there to

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,940
open those files.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,190
But if you want more options with those files you just click on this more menu here and we have other

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,090
options like sharing duplicating renaming things like that.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,870
Now we have different ways of browsing our files over here on the left.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,090
We can browse by most recent the drafts or deleted files and we can also create new teams so we can

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,050
share files inside of teams for different collaborators.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,490
And this is where you're going to create new teams.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,940
I'll talk more about this in a future video but this is where you're going to be able to find your teams.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,960
Also if you want to change any account settings you can click on this down arrow here and we can change

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,250
our account settings and we can also get the desktop app and I'm going to show you how to do that in

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,320
a future video as well.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,620
Now if you don't want to start off with the figure file we can actually import files here so we can

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,150
import figment sketch files images different things like that if we want to start off with a different

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,380
document.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,000
Now over here to the right is the notifications icon and we're not going to see any notifications yet

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,200
but as people start to collaborate with you and they start to comment and things like that you're going

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,090
to find those notifications here.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,590
Lastly if you have any questions about Sigma there's this help and resources icon here where you can

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,410
get access to some video tutorials.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,130
The community forum and things like that.
