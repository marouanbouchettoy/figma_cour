Now they were signed up for figment we can see the start screen here and this is where we get access

00:04.470 --> 00:05.830
to all of our files.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.620
So we have three sample files that figure has given us and we can always double click into there to

00:10.620 --> 00:11.940
open those files.

00:12.060 --> 00:17.190
But if you want more options with those files you just click on this more menu here and we have other

00:17.190 --> 00:21.090
options like sharing duplicating renaming things like that.

00:21.090 --> 00:23.870
Now we have different ways of browsing our files over here on the left.

00:23.880 --> 00:30.090
We can browse by most recent the drafts or deleted files and we can also create new teams so we can

00:30.090 --> 00:34.050
share files inside of teams for different collaborators.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.490
And this is where you're going to create new teams.

00:36.510 --> 00:40.940
I'll talk more about this in a future video but this is where you're going to be able to find your teams.

00:41.010 --> 00:45.960
Also if you want to change any account settings you can click on this down arrow here and we can change

00:45.960 --> 00:50.250
our account settings and we can also get the desktop app and I'm going to show you how to do that in

00:50.250 --> 00:51.320
a future video as well.

00:52.300 --> 00:56.620
Now if you don't want to start off with the figure file we can actually import files here so we can

00:56.620 --> 01:01.150
import figment sketch files images different things like that if we want to start off with a different

01:01.150 --> 01:02.380
document.

01:02.470 --> 01:07.000
Now over here to the right is the notifications icon and we're not going to see any notifications yet

01:07.030 --> 01:11.200
but as people start to collaborate with you and they start to comment and things like that you're going

01:11.200 --> 01:13.090
to find those notifications here.

01:13.090 --> 01:17.590
Lastly if you have any questions about Sigma there's this help and resources icon here where you can

01:17.590 --> 01:19.410
get access to some video tutorials.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.130
The community forum and things like that.
