1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,030
Let's talk about what you can find inside the Sigma menu bar to the right I have Sigma open in a web

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:12,660
browser and to the left I have the open inside of the fig my desktop app and there are many benefits

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,010
to running this inside of the app and that starts with the menu screen and in both of these windows

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,800
I'm going to open up a new file.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,500
And if you don't have any existing files you can just click on new file.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,140
It doesn't matter what file you open up I'm just going to show you the menu bar.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,440
So I'm going to click on both of these to open them up.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,460
And first off with the menu bar as you can see we have File Edit View history bookmarks people window

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:35,990
help.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,900
And this is the Chrome browser.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,620
But if I click on Fig MMA now you have things that are associated with the Enigma object vector text.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,080
And these tools come in really handy when you're designing with stigma.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,890
You can find these same menu options inside of the Chrome browser if you click in Chrome click on this

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,420
hamburger menu and you have some of these same things.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,320
I'm going to discuss the menu items inside the app but if you are using Chrome or in other web browser

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,830
you can follow along in this hamburger menu going from left to right here we have file.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,540
And this is where you can start new projects or files you can close and open tabs and you can also save

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,820
your projects as a dot Fig.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,530
Now when you're usually editing projects you don't have to save as you're editing because everything

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,070
is a lie.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,160
And on the browser.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,550
But if you want to save an off line instance to store or archive you can click on the Save as fig or

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,610
you can export different files in your project here within the Edit menu we have a typical undo redo

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,140
cut copy and paste.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,920
And we also have paste in place and then some great tools that we have our pick color.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,760
So if there's already a color that you like inside of your project you can choose this pick color and

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,190
click anywhere within this canvas to choose that color and any objects that you have selected will adopt

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,300
that color.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,540
You can also set default styles for shapes that you're creating.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,900
So when I click on this rectangle tool and I just draw a rectangle here the default style is this gray

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,650
color if I choose to have this black and I have a purple stroke for example and I choose the weight

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,010
of the stroke to be 10 pixels.

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,690
Now I can click on this object I can go to Edit and set default style.

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,550
And now when I click on this rectangle again and draw a new rectangle it's always going to adopt that

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,760
same style about I set.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,660
Now there's also copy style and paste style.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,980
So again if I draw these two rectangles here I can set a style here.

38
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's change this back to white and instead of changing this one back to White I can click here.

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,240
Copy this style and then click onto this object and paste the style here and it will adopt the same

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,110
styles that I have set.

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,570
You can also choose to select all and that select everything within the canvas which are just these

42
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,770
two objects right now you can select none.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,170
Or if I select this guy and go into edit and select Inv. this will select everything besides what I

44
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,010
already have selected which is this object here.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,570
Now there are also some great selection filters that are very powerful so to illustrate this I'm going

46
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,320
to copy these two objects here and I'm going to hold down option and drag to duplicate these.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,910
And with these two objects I'm going to change the fill.

48
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,970
Let's change it to black again.

49
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,930
And now with these objects if I click one of these and go into edit I can select everything that has

50
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,270
the same style.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,830
So if I click on this it's going to select only these two objects or I can choose to select all just

52
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,090
with the same fill.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,910
And that's also again going to be these two objects.

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,310
And so you can see kind of what this is doing.

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,720
You can select every element within your project that has the same text and then you can quickly change

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,390
that text throughout your project even if it's through 100 art boards or frames.

57
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,360
You can change that text within seconds.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,920
These may sound like very simple options but allows for powerful editing techniques.

59
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,510
And lastly if you want to add any emoji or symbols into your design you can find those here now to show

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,100
you things inside of the view menu.

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,360
First I have to create a frame and we'll talk more about this later but I just want to create one real

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,520
quick to illustrate how the view menu works show pixel grid works if you enable this it will show you

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,660
the pixels themselves.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,600
If I zoom in holding down command you can see this little grid showing each individual pixel.

65
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,370
So that comes in handy when you're trying to place your design on pixels.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,300
You can also show layout grids.

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,080
So it's enabled right now but we don't have a layout so I'm going to just click plus and you can see

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,650
that that shows the grid.

69
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,890
Or you can hide this.

70
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,360
There are other view options like shole mask outlines of your masking some objects together you can

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,420
kind of show where those outline are bounding boxes are.

72
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,030
You can show the rollers here height and show you can show different panels so you can toggle the layers

73
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,110
panel on and off here and you can toggle the entire user interface to show or hide.

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,420
So everything's hidden in kind of a full screen view here.

75
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,770
And then if you want to show just the outlines of your design you can click on this and it hides everything

76
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,040
else.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,820
The styling shows you where the outlines are for your project.

78
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,980
And now the pixel preview option if you click on that I'm going to zoom in to illustrate this.

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,660
You can kind of see that everything looks sharp right here because it's vector.

80
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,710
But if I rotate this for example you can see that it starts to get blurry and that's because it's showing

81
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,460
us a preview of what it will look like if this vector was displayed on these pixels on a device.

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,640
You can also choose to show a transparency checkerboard and pretty much what this does is if there's

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,510
anything transparent inside of this frame or canvas it'll create a checkerboard showing you that it's

84
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,520
see through.

85
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,150
When you export it it's going to be transparent.

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,820
In this section we have a few zoom controls.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,120
And next we can find the next art board and it'll switch over to the right or previous our board will

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,190
switch to the art board over to the left.

89
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,820
So if I click on this frame for example and I hold down option to duplicate it I have this frame selected

90
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,890
I can go into view and I can say I want to find the previous art board was going to jump to this one

91
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,350
on the left.

92
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,710
Next we can just enter full screen and I'll just zoom everything up to be front and center.

93
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,010
And now we have the object menu.

94
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,140
So let's zoom out here so we can see both of these boards I can click on object and this is where you

95
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,330
can group different selections or ungroup you can frame a selection.

96
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,160
So if I click on these two objects and choose frame selection you will wrap your objects around a frame

97
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,060
and this is a little bit different than grouping and I'll show you why in a future video.

98
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,650
Now we have a few component options and the great thing about component's is that it allows you to reuse

99
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,370
a symbol or a design throughout your entire project and to make quick changes very easily.

100
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,630
I'm going to cover this in a lot more detail in a future video but these options here will allow you

101
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,140
to create a component so it converts this frame into a component as you can see here.

102
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,620
And then here you can go to master component.

103
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,880
Now because we only have one master component here if I copy this 500 times let's say I can select one

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,160
of these copies I can jump in here and select go to master component and it'll just jump to that master

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,760
component so I can make those quick changes.

106
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,980
Also if I click on one of the child components and thereby change the color or the stroke to be different

107
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:21,040
than that Master component I can always click on this reset instance and it'll reset the style to what

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,660
the master component is.

109
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,720
Next let's say you have a master component and a few child components and one of the child components

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,940
you want to be able to edit the size in the stroke and everything and you don't want it to be affected

111
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,430
by the master component.

112
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,200
You can always detach this and convert it back into a frame where it's not a component by detaching

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
this from the master component.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,050
Now I know this all probably sounds really confusing right now but don't worry because I'm going to

115
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,870
cover this in a future video.

116
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,970
This is the power of Sigma with components and collaborative editing and it's going to take a dedicated

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,690
video in itself to really explain how this works.

118
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,570
Now you have some other object settings so you can resize an object to fit inside of a frame and you

119
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,570
can toggle some object clipping to clip and be masked behind another object or not.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,640
These options here allow you to bring objects back and forth in the layering scheme and to show you

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,740
that here I'm just going to click on this object I'm going to hold down option I'm going to drag this

122
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,690
to create a copy and you can obviously see this layer is on top of this layer here.

123
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,960
And so if I want to move this around in the layers panel I can click on send it back and I'll send this

124
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,840
to the very back or I can go to object and bring forward bring forward bring forward it'll bring that

125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,450
forward three times and the layering scheme.

126
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,590
You have some quick flip options if you want to flip this horizontal you're vertically.

127
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,040
Some quick rotation options.

128
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,750
You can also flatten selection so you can see the selection also shows that it's rotated here.

129
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,400
But if I click on Flaten selection for example it's going to flatten this and now I have selection handles

130
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,010
that are parallel to my art board.

131
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,470
So the difference here if I click on this other object you can see the width is 150 pixels.

132
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,890
And now because the selection handle is contained perpendicular to my frame it shows that with as 175

133
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,320
pixels and there are some great reasons why you would want to do that for some particular objects but

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,260
just know that you have that ability here subsumed into my canvas here and now if I click on this rectangle

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,970
you can click on any rectangle you want inside of here as long as it has a stroke.

136
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,730
And now if I go into object and I click on this outline stroke what that does is converts this stroke

137
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,660
into an outline.

138
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,140
So if I click on this you can see now that I have this outline.

139
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,910
So now when I double click inside of here you can see that this isn't a stroke but it's actually a shape

140
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,030
that I can now manipulate the inside of the shape in the outside of this shape.

141
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,460
And this comes in handy sometimes because now when I realize this you can see that this stroke that

142
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,520
I've converted to an outline actually resizes with it a scroll down here and select this object.

143
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,760
Now I'm going to go back into object and we have some bullion options and I'm going to talk about this

144
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
in another video too.

145
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,200
But essentially you can join some selections together so if you have two rectangles if you click on

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,440
union it'll match those to be one shape or you can subtract one shape from another like a cookie cutter

147
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,490
method.

148
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,320
And there are a few other options here to manipulate these multiple objects to combined into one shape.

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,500
Now if you ever want to duplicate any objects in place you can hold down Kamandi or you can click this

150
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,810
duplicate selection in place and then you can delete raster selection.

151
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,460
If I click on this this turns a vector shape into a raster rise to a graphic.

152
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:50,330
So now this is an image and if I resize this image you can see the stroke get skewed and things start

153
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:56,600
to look a little bit weird here and I can also click on this filled image option here and change things

154
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,510
like the exposure the contrast saturation and any other image editing options.

155
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,290
Now clicking on this shape here I'm going to go into object and you can show or hightest selection.

156
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,330
So I click on this to hide it.

157
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,190
You can see that what that does is it toggles this little eyeball icon in the layers panel to show and

158
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,020
hide.

159
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,480
You can also lock or unlock a selection so you don't accidentally change it.

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,630
So this is hidden and locked but I can show it and have it still be locked so if I drag any rectangles

161
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm never going to select that and I won't be able to edit this accidentally again this is just a toggle

162
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,280
button to unlock and lock through here.

163
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,200
And next you can select a few layers then you can click on hide other layers and it will hide everything

164
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
that's not selected.

165
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,030
Now if you ever want to quickly remove a file or remove a stroke or swap the fill and stroke these options

166
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,440
are here.

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,010
So now we have purple is the Phil Black as the stroke and we can just choose to remove the feel altogether.

168
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,690
And now if I drag this over some of these objects you can kind of see that the black is layered over

169
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,180
it but there is not any feel inside of there.

170
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,940
Now to show you some items in the vector menu but I'm going to do is just delete this frame here.

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm going to drag this over and then just delete all the objects in here so I just have one blank frame.

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,010
And now this vector menu gives you some great options so I'll show you kind of how these work.

173
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,590
I'm going to click on the pen tool here and I'll show you this tool in more detail a little bit later

174
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,900
but let's say we have some weird shape here.

175
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,040
And I hit escape and say that I'm done.

176
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,430
Well what happens if we want to close this shape later.

177
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,580
What I can do is double click on this object and then I can choose this node here.

178
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,290
And if I hold down shift I can select this note as well.

179
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,890
And now I jump into vector I can join the selection which will interpret and just create a solid line

180
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,470
and between the two open paths.

181
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,190
But now if I click commands or control Z on Windows I can go back and Vector.

182
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,120
And now I can say I want a smooth join the selection which will interpret this and make the path really

183
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,770
smooth an other thing I may want to do is I can double click on this object again and let's say I don't

184
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,730
want this node inside of my selection here so I can select this note again go into vector and delete

185
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,000
and heal a selection and that will delete this node but it will also try to retain a similar shape that

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,620
that node was taking care of.

187
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,350
Sometimes when you use fewer nodes inside of your vector icons your curves become smoother and it feels

188
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,090
more organic.

189
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,790
So these three tools can be really powerful.

190
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Now let's click done here and I'm going to just delete this shape and just for illustration purposes

191
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,270
I'm going to add some text.

192
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,050
We have a text box here.

193
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm going to increase the size here to 48 so we can see it.

194
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,360
And now this text menu gives us a nice toggle bold taluk underline we can convert text to it's original

195
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,860
case or uppercase or lowercase.

196
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,600
Now this 4:03 layout option isn't something that you're hardly ever going to use if ever this force

197
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:09,770
is text objects in the collection to be laid out again if fonts you're using got updated it just verifies

198
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,230
that all the fonts are pre-rendered to make sure they're using the latest version of that font.

199
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,780
I've never used this yet.

200
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,120
I don't think you will either.

201
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,820
Now to show you some features in the arr. menu.

202
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:29,170
I'm going to create a few objects here so I'm just going to draw a few rectangles and hold down option.

203
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,890
Just copy this.

204
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,620
So we have four rectangles here.

205
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,850
If we select all of these we have some arr. options.

206
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,530
We can round two pixels to make sure that the sizes of these are on subpixel like 100 point five pixels.

207
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,230
So this will round them to whole pixels in case that accident ever happens.

208
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,310
And then you can arrange by aligning objects to the left.

209
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,870
We're going to click command Z here.

210
00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:02,240
You can also align to top and you can also pack things so packing things horizontally fits each object

211
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,800
side by side packing them tightly so there's no margin between those objects.

212
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,820
Again you can pack these vertically and that will do the same thing making sure that they fit nice and

213
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,900
snug against each other vertically and then you have some distribute options so you can distribute horizontally

214
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,460
you can distribute to the top vertically or distribute bottom.

215
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,190
So these settings just help you arrange objects evenly or align them evenly with each other.

216
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,750
You can find a lot of those same options here as well.

217
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,030
Now under window we have some basic controls like minimize this window.

218
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,500
Zoom in to fill the entire screen.

219
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,860
You can also select previous and next tabs.

220
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,140
Here we only have one tab open but let's say you have three files open you can jump back and forth between

221
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,450
them.

222
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,690
With these options or you can bring all Sigma windows to the front inside help.

223
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,510
I really love this search inside the Mac help.

224
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,640
So if I want to find a certain feature in one of these menu options I can just type it in here like

225
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:10,900
outline and I can find this outline stroke option actually lives under object and right here so you

226
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,160
can quickly find the settings that you're looking for inside the menubar.

227
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,010
There's also some help in tutorial files and this is where you'll sign out of Sigma or you can toggle

228
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,210
developer tools on and off.

229
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,480
I've never used these it's basically just an inspector mode just like you'll see in Chrome.

230
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,930
So you'll get to see some of the H chainmail that makes up these objects here.

231
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,940
But again I've never used this and I don't think you will either.

232
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,250
So that's just a brief introduction of the menu items here.

233
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,090
We're going to go over a lot more of these in much more detail.

234
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,100
I know I went over them really fast.

235
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,350
It's just to get you basically introduced to some of these things so that you know where you can find

236
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,850
different options if you want to go out and design on your own and just play with it.

237
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,650
But again some of these options want a much more detailed video to explain so I'll do that in future

238
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,320
videos.
