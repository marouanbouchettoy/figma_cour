WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:06.030
Let's talk about what you can find inside the Sigma menu bar to the right I have Sigma open in a web

00:06.030 --> 00:12.660
browser and to the left I have the open inside of the fig my desktop app and there are many benefits

00:12.660 --> 00:17.010
to running this inside of the app and that starts with the menu screen and in both of these windows

00:17.010 --> 00:18.800
I'm going to open up a new file.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.500
And if you don't have any existing files you can just click on new file.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.140
It doesn't matter what file you open up I'm just going to show you the menu bar.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.440
So I'm going to click on both of these to open them up.

00:29.940 --> 00:35.460
And first off with the menu bar as you can see we have File Edit View history bookmarks people window

00:35.460 --> 00:35.990
help.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.900
And this is the Chrome browser.

00:37.920 --> 00:44.620
But if I click on Fig MMA now you have things that are associated with the Enigma object vector text.

00:44.970 --> 00:48.080
And these tools come in really handy when you're designing with stigma.

00:48.150 --> 00:52.890
You can find these same menu options inside of the Chrome browser if you click in Chrome click on this

00:52.890 --> 00:56.420
hamburger menu and you have some of these same things.

00:56.610 --> 01:01.320
I'm going to discuss the menu items inside the app but if you are using Chrome or in other web browser

01:01.320 --> 01:06.830
you can follow along in this hamburger menu going from left to right here we have file.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.540
And this is where you can start new projects or files you can close and open tabs and you can also save

01:12.540 --> 01:14.820
your projects as a dot Fig.

01:14.820 --> 01:18.530
Now when you're usually editing projects you don't have to save as you're editing because everything

01:18.530 --> 01:19.070
is a lie.

01:19.070 --> 01:20.160
And on the browser.

01:20.370 --> 01:26.550
But if you want to save an off line instance to store or archive you can click on the Save as fig or

01:26.550 --> 01:32.610
you can export different files in your project here within the Edit menu we have a typical undo redo

01:32.610 --> 01:34.140
cut copy and paste.

01:34.140 --> 01:39.920
And we also have paste in place and then some great tools that we have our pick color.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.760
So if there's already a color that you like inside of your project you can choose this pick color and

01:44.760 --> 01:50.190
click anywhere within this canvas to choose that color and any objects that you have selected will adopt

01:50.190 --> 01:51.300
that color.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.540
You can also set default styles for shapes that you're creating.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.900
So when I click on this rectangle tool and I just draw a rectangle here the default style is this gray

02:00.900 --> 02:07.650
color if I choose to have this black and I have a purple stroke for example and I choose the weight

02:07.650 --> 02:11.010
of the stroke to be 10 pixels.

02:11.010 --> 02:15.690
Now I can click on this object I can go to Edit and set default style.

02:15.930 --> 02:20.550
And now when I click on this rectangle again and draw a new rectangle it's always going to adopt that

02:20.550 --> 02:22.760
same style about I set.

02:22.770 --> 02:25.660
Now there's also copy style and paste style.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.980
So again if I draw these two rectangles here I can set a style here.

02:31.050 --> 02:37.000
Let's change this back to white and instead of changing this one back to White I can click here.

02:37.020 --> 02:42.240
Copy this style and then click onto this object and paste the style here and it will adopt the same

02:42.240 --> 02:44.110
styles that I have set.

02:44.130 --> 02:48.570
You can also choose to select all and that select everything within the canvas which are just these

02:48.570 --> 02:51.770
two objects right now you can select none.

02:51.960 --> 02:58.170
Or if I select this guy and go into edit and select Inv. this will select everything besides what I

02:58.170 --> 03:01.010
already have selected which is this object here.

03:01.020 --> 03:06.570
Now there are also some great selection filters that are very powerful so to illustrate this I'm going

03:06.570 --> 03:12.320
to copy these two objects here and I'm going to hold down option and drag to duplicate these.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.910
And with these two objects I'm going to change the fill.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.970
Let's change it to black again.

03:17.220 --> 03:21.930
And now with these objects if I click one of these and go into edit I can select everything that has

03:21.930 --> 03:23.270
the same style.

03:23.280 --> 03:28.830
So if I click on this it's going to select only these two objects or I can choose to select all just

03:28.830 --> 03:30.090
with the same fill.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.910
And that's also again going to be these two objects.

03:32.910 --> 03:35.310
And so you can see kind of what this is doing.

03:35.460 --> 03:39.720
You can select every element within your project that has the same text and then you can quickly change

03:39.720 --> 03:44.390
that text throughout your project even if it's through 100 art boards or frames.

03:44.670 --> 03:47.360
You can change that text within seconds.

03:47.370 --> 03:51.920
These may sound like very simple options but allows for powerful editing techniques.

03:52.050 --> 03:57.510
And lastly if you want to add any emoji or symbols into your design you can find those here now to show

03:57.510 --> 03:59.100
you things inside of the view menu.

03:59.100 --> 04:03.360
First I have to create a frame and we'll talk more about this later but I just want to create one real

04:03.360 --> 04:11.520
quick to illustrate how the view menu works show pixel grid works if you enable this it will show you

04:11.520 --> 04:12.660
the pixels themselves.

04:12.660 --> 04:17.600
If I zoom in holding down command you can see this little grid showing each individual pixel.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.370
So that comes in handy when you're trying to place your design on pixels.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.300
You can also show layout grids.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.080
So it's enabled right now but we don't have a layout so I'm going to just click plus and you can see

04:28.080 --> 04:29.650
that that shows the grid.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.890
Or you can hide this.

04:32.010 --> 04:36.360
There are other view options like shole mask outlines of your masking some objects together you can

04:36.360 --> 04:39.420
kind of show where those outline are bounding boxes are.

04:39.690 --> 04:45.030
You can show the rollers here height and show you can show different panels so you can toggle the layers

04:45.030 --> 04:51.110
panel on and off here and you can toggle the entire user interface to show or hide.

04:51.110 --> 04:54.420
So everything's hidden in kind of a full screen view here.

04:54.510 --> 04:58.770
And then if you want to show just the outlines of your design you can click on this and it hides everything

04:58.770 --> 04:59.040
else.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.820
The styling shows you where the outlines are for your project.

05:05.730 --> 05:10.980
And now the pixel preview option if you click on that I'm going to zoom in to illustrate this.

05:10.980 --> 05:14.660
You can kind of see that everything looks sharp right here because it's vector.

05:14.790 --> 05:19.710
But if I rotate this for example you can see that it starts to get blurry and that's because it's showing

05:19.710 --> 05:26.460
us a preview of what it will look like if this vector was displayed on these pixels on a device.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.640
You can also choose to show a transparency checkerboard and pretty much what this does is if there's

05:32.680 --> 05:37.510
anything transparent inside of this frame or canvas it'll create a checkerboard showing you that it's

05:37.510 --> 05:38.520
see through.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.150
When you export it it's going to be transparent.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.820
In this section we have a few zoom controls.

05:43.960 --> 05:49.120
And next we can find the next art board and it'll switch over to the right or previous our board will

05:49.120 --> 05:51.190
switch to the art board over to the left.

05:51.190 --> 05:57.820
So if I click on this frame for example and I hold down option to duplicate it I have this frame selected

05:58.120 --> 06:02.890
I can go into view and I can say I want to find the previous art board was going to jump to this one

06:02.890 --> 06:04.350
on the left.

06:04.390 --> 06:09.710
Next we can just enter full screen and I'll just zoom everything up to be front and center.

06:09.850 --> 06:12.010
And now we have the object menu.

06:12.430 --> 06:17.140
So let's zoom out here so we can see both of these boards I can click on object and this is where you

06:17.140 --> 06:21.330
can group different selections or ungroup you can frame a selection.

06:21.340 --> 06:27.160
So if I click on these two objects and choose frame selection you will wrap your objects around a frame

06:27.340 --> 06:31.060
and this is a little bit different than grouping and I'll show you why in a future video.

06:31.060 --> 06:35.650
Now we have a few component options and the great thing about component's is that it allows you to reuse

06:36.070 --> 06:42.370
a symbol or a design throughout your entire project and to make quick changes very easily.

06:42.370 --> 06:46.630
I'm going to cover this in a lot more detail in a future video but these options here will allow you

06:46.630 --> 06:51.140
to create a component so it converts this frame into a component as you can see here.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.620
And then here you can go to master component.

06:53.800 --> 07:00.880
Now because we only have one master component here if I copy this 500 times let's say I can select one

07:00.880 --> 07:06.160
of these copies I can jump in here and select go to master component and it'll just jump to that master

07:06.160 --> 07:08.760
component so I can make those quick changes.

07:08.890 --> 07:14.980
Also if I click on one of the child components and thereby change the color or the stroke to be different

07:14.980 --> 07:21.040
than that Master component I can always click on this reset instance and it'll reset the style to what

07:21.040 --> 07:22.660
the master component is.

07:22.870 --> 07:28.720
Next let's say you have a master component and a few child components and one of the child components

07:28.720 --> 07:33.940
you want to be able to edit the size in the stroke and everything and you don't want it to be affected

07:33.940 --> 07:35.430
by the master component.

07:35.710 --> 07:41.200
You can always detach this and convert it back into a frame where it's not a component by detaching

07:41.200 --> 07:43.000
this from the master component.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.050
Now I know this all probably sounds really confusing right now but don't worry because I'm going to

07:47.050 --> 07:48.870
cover this in a future video.

07:48.870 --> 07:54.970
This is the power of Sigma with components and collaborative editing and it's going to take a dedicated

07:54.970 --> 07:58.690
video in itself to really explain how this works.

07:58.690 --> 08:04.570
Now you have some other object settings so you can resize an object to fit inside of a frame and you

08:04.570 --> 08:10.570
can toggle some object clipping to clip and be masked behind another object or not.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.640
These options here allow you to bring objects back and forth in the layering scheme and to show you

08:15.640 --> 08:20.740
that here I'm just going to click on this object I'm going to hold down option I'm going to drag this

08:20.740 --> 08:25.690
to create a copy and you can obviously see this layer is on top of this layer here.

08:25.900 --> 08:31.960
And so if I want to move this around in the layers panel I can click on send it back and I'll send this

08:31.960 --> 08:37.840
to the very back or I can go to object and bring forward bring forward bring forward it'll bring that

08:37.840 --> 08:40.450
forward three times and the layering scheme.

08:40.540 --> 08:44.590
You have some quick flip options if you want to flip this horizontal you're vertically.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.040
Some quick rotation options.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.750
You can also flatten selection so you can see the selection also shows that it's rotated here.

08:51.760 --> 08:57.400
But if I click on Flaten selection for example it's going to flatten this and now I have selection handles

08:57.400 --> 09:00.010
that are parallel to my art board.

09:00.010 --> 09:05.470
So the difference here if I click on this other object you can see the width is 150 pixels.

09:05.620 --> 09:11.890
And now because the selection handle is contained perpendicular to my frame it shows that with as 175

09:11.890 --> 09:17.320
pixels and there are some great reasons why you would want to do that for some particular objects but

09:17.320 --> 09:23.260
just know that you have that ability here subsumed into my canvas here and now if I click on this rectangle

09:23.260 --> 09:27.970
you can click on any rectangle you want inside of here as long as it has a stroke.

09:27.970 --> 09:33.730
And now if I go into object and I click on this outline stroke what that does is converts this stroke

09:33.760 --> 09:34.660
into an outline.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.140
So if I click on this you can see now that I have this outline.

09:38.230 --> 09:42.910
So now when I double click inside of here you can see that this isn't a stroke but it's actually a shape

09:42.910 --> 09:49.030
that I can now manipulate the inside of the shape in the outside of this shape.

09:49.140 --> 09:54.460
And this comes in handy sometimes because now when I realize this you can see that this stroke that

09:54.460 --> 10:00.520
I've converted to an outline actually resizes with it a scroll down here and select this object.

10:00.520 --> 10:06.760
Now I'm going to go back into object and we have some bullion options and I'm going to talk about this

10:06.760 --> 10:08.280
in another video too.

10:08.500 --> 10:14.200
But essentially you can join some selections together so if you have two rectangles if you click on

10:14.200 --> 10:20.440
union it'll match those to be one shape or you can subtract one shape from another like a cookie cutter

10:20.800 --> 10:21.490
method.

10:21.700 --> 10:27.320
And there are a few other options here to manipulate these multiple objects to combined into one shape.

10:27.320 --> 10:33.500
Now if you ever want to duplicate any objects in place you can hold down Kamandi or you can click this

10:33.680 --> 10:38.810
duplicate selection in place and then you can delete raster selection.

10:38.810 --> 10:43.460
If I click on this this turns a vector shape into a raster rise to a graphic.

10:43.610 --> 10:50.330
So now this is an image and if I resize this image you can see the stroke get skewed and things start

10:50.330 --> 10:56.600
to look a little bit weird here and I can also click on this filled image option here and change things

10:56.600 --> 11:01.510
like the exposure the contrast saturation and any other image editing options.

11:01.520 --> 11:08.290
Now clicking on this shape here I'm going to go into object and you can show or hightest selection.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.330
So I click on this to hide it.

11:10.480 --> 11:15.190
You can see that what that does is it toggles this little eyeball icon in the layers panel to show and

11:15.190 --> 11:16.020
hide.

11:16.030 --> 11:19.480
You can also lock or unlock a selection so you don't accidentally change it.

11:19.480 --> 11:25.630
So this is hidden and locked but I can show it and have it still be locked so if I drag any rectangles

11:25.660 --> 11:31.880
I'm never going to select that and I won't be able to edit this accidentally again this is just a toggle

11:31.880 --> 11:34.280
button to unlock and lock through here.

11:34.550 --> 11:39.200
And next you can select a few layers then you can click on hide other layers and it will hide everything

11:39.200 --> 11:41.300
that's not selected.

11:41.300 --> 11:47.030
Now if you ever want to quickly remove a file or remove a stroke or swap the fill and stroke these options

11:47.030 --> 11:47.440
are here.

11:47.440 --> 11:54.010
So now we have purple is the Phil Black as the stroke and we can just choose to remove the feel altogether.

11:54.410 --> 11:59.690
And now if I drag this over some of these objects you can kind of see that the black is layered over

11:59.690 --> 12:02.180
it but there is not any feel inside of there.

12:02.390 --> 12:06.940
Now to show you some items in the vector menu but I'm going to do is just delete this frame here.

12:07.160 --> 12:13.840
I'm going to drag this over and then just delete all the objects in here so I just have one blank frame.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.010
And now this vector menu gives you some great options so I'll show you kind of how these work.

12:19.010 --> 12:23.590
I'm going to click on the pen tool here and I'll show you this tool in more detail a little bit later

12:23.600 --> 12:25.900
but let's say we have some weird shape here.

12:26.090 --> 12:29.040
And I hit escape and say that I'm done.

12:29.090 --> 12:32.430
Well what happens if we want to close this shape later.

12:32.460 --> 12:37.580
What I can do is double click on this object and then I can choose this node here.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.290
And if I hold down shift I can select this note as well.

12:41.520 --> 12:46.890
And now I jump into vector I can join the selection which will interpret and just create a solid line

12:46.890 --> 12:49.470
and between the two open paths.

12:49.470 --> 12:54.190
But now if I click commands or control Z on Windows I can go back and Vector.

12:54.300 --> 13:00.120
And now I can say I want a smooth join the selection which will interpret this and make the path really

13:00.120 --> 13:06.770
smooth an other thing I may want to do is I can double click on this object again and let's say I don't

13:06.770 --> 13:13.730
want this node inside of my selection here so I can select this note again go into vector and delete

13:13.770 --> 13:20.000
and heal a selection and that will delete this node but it will also try to retain a similar shape that

13:20.000 --> 13:21.620
that node was taking care of.

13:21.860 --> 13:27.350
Sometimes when you use fewer nodes inside of your vector icons your curves become smoother and it feels

13:27.350 --> 13:29.090
more organic.

13:29.090 --> 13:31.790
So these three tools can be really powerful.

13:31.790 --> 13:37.790
Now let's click done here and I'm going to just delete this shape and just for illustration purposes

13:37.790 --> 13:41.270
I'm going to add some text.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.050
We have a text box here.

13:44.090 --> 13:47.380
I'm going to increase the size here to 48 so we can see it.

13:47.420 --> 13:53.360
And now this text menu gives us a nice toggle bold taluk underline we can convert text to it's original

13:53.360 --> 13:57.860
case or uppercase or lowercase.

13:57.860 --> 14:03.600
Now this 4:03 layout option isn't something that you're hardly ever going to use if ever this force

14:03.590 --> 14:09.770
is text objects in the collection to be laid out again if fonts you're using got updated it just verifies

14:09.770 --> 14:14.230
that all the fonts are pre-rendered to make sure they're using the latest version of that font.

14:14.510 --> 14:15.780
I've never used this yet.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.120
I don't think you will either.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.820
Now to show you some features in the arr. menu.

14:20.930 --> 14:29.170
I'm going to create a few objects here so I'm just going to draw a few rectangles and hold down option.

14:29.220 --> 14:29.890
Just copy this.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.620
So we have four rectangles here.

14:31.730 --> 14:34.850
If we select all of these we have some arr. options.

14:34.850 --> 14:42.530
We can round two pixels to make sure that the sizes of these are on subpixel like 100 point five pixels.

14:42.530 --> 14:47.230
So this will round them to whole pixels in case that accident ever happens.

14:47.390 --> 14:51.310
And then you can arrange by aligning objects to the left.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.870
We're going to click command Z here.

14:53.870 --> 15:02.240
You can also align to top and you can also pack things so packing things horizontally fits each object

15:02.240 --> 15:07.800
side by side packing them tightly so there's no margin between those objects.

15:07.880 --> 15:13.820
Again you can pack these vertically and that will do the same thing making sure that they fit nice and

15:13.820 --> 15:20.900
snug against each other vertically and then you have some distribute options so you can distribute horizontally

15:22.060 --> 15:26.460
you can distribute to the top vertically or distribute bottom.

15:26.500 --> 15:32.190
So these settings just help you arrange objects evenly or align them evenly with each other.

15:32.350 --> 15:35.750
You can find a lot of those same options here as well.

15:35.770 --> 15:40.030
Now under window we have some basic controls like minimize this window.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.500
Zoom in to fill the entire screen.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.860
You can also select previous and next tabs.

15:44.860 --> 15:50.140
Here we only have one tab open but let's say you have three files open you can jump back and forth between

15:50.140 --> 15:50.450
them.

15:50.470 --> 15:55.690
With these options or you can bring all Sigma windows to the front inside help.

15:55.690 --> 15:58.510
I really love this search inside the Mac help.

15:58.510 --> 16:03.640
So if I want to find a certain feature in one of these menu options I can just type it in here like

16:03.700 --> 16:10.900
outline and I can find this outline stroke option actually lives under object and right here so you

16:10.900 --> 16:15.160
can quickly find the settings that you're looking for inside the menubar.

16:15.160 --> 16:21.010
There's also some help in tutorial files and this is where you'll sign out of Sigma or you can toggle

16:21.010 --> 16:23.210
developer tools on and off.

16:23.260 --> 16:28.480
I've never used these it's basically just an inspector mode just like you'll see in Chrome.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.930
So you'll get to see some of the H chainmail that makes up these objects here.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.940
But again I've never used this and I don't think you will either.

16:36.970 --> 16:40.250
So that's just a brief introduction of the menu items here.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.090
We're going to go over a lot more of these in much more detail.

16:43.090 --> 16:45.100
I know I went over them really fast.

16:45.220 --> 16:50.350
It's just to get you basically introduced to some of these things so that you know where you can find

16:50.350 --> 16:54.850
different options if you want to go out and design on your own and just play with it.

16:54.850 --> 16:59.650
But again some of these options want a much more detailed video to explain so I'll do that in future

16:59.650 --> 17:00.320
videos.
