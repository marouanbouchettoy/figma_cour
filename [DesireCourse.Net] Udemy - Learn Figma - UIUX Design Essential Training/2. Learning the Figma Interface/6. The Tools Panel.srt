1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,100
To show you the tools panel I'm going to start off with a fresh new project so to follow along.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,130
Just start a new project and we can just work our way from there the first time I'm going to do in the

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,410
Tools menu is create a new frame and this frame tool is used to create new art boards and also to frame

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,720
certain sections like a navigation menu bar or an iPhone navigation footer to start off.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,370
You can see here on the right we have different presets for frames that we want to create.

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,900
So I can create an iPhone X frame for example here and I can just click on that and it'll plop that

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,860
directly in the canvas or if I click on this frame tool I can drag and create a custom frame size at

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,720
whatever size that I want.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm going to delete this frame and let's just keep this iPhone X frame as we move along.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,600
Now to select any objects you have this move tool this move and select.

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,000
So now I can click on the name of this frame and I can move it.

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,360
Now I want to create a few shapes So here's where you'll find your shapes.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,720
I can quickly draw some rectangles here.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,370
And if I click on this dropdown arrow I have more shape options so here I can draw an ellipse and I

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:18,550
can hold down shift to constrain this proportionately and I'll just drag this around.

16
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:26,450
And we have a few of these other one star tool polygon and you lips I'll just place these ones for now.

17
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,000
Now I can also scale these objects if I have this circle for example I can click on this down arrow

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,540
next to the move tool and I can click on the scale tool and I can just drag any one of these drag handles

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,900
and scale this down or up as I see fit.

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,070
Now those are great for simple shapes and I'm going to just select both of these and drag them up a

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,620
little bit.

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,150
But I can also create custom shapes using this pen tool.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,890
For example if I want to quickly create a shape of a heart let's say I can do that here and I'll show

24
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,000
you more how to use these controls to create your own shapes.

25
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,970
I'm just drawing something quick to show you where these tools live and kind of how they work.

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,600
And you can see here when we're inside the pen tool we have other options here too.

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:21,740
So we can use this paint bucket tool for example to click and paint a certain color inside of that stroke

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,720
or that shape and we can also use this bend tool to select certain nodes and bend the shape.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,960
If you want to design something more freeform like a signature for example you can use this down arrow

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,070
and select the pencil tool.

31
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,590
But before I do that I'm just going to click done here because I don't want to create the same shape

32
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,260
inside of this that instance.

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,120
So now I'm going to click on this down arrow and click on the pencil tool.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,630
And here's where I can create a quick signature.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,630
And I'm using a mouse so it's kind of messy.

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,310
But you can see how freeform that is.

37
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:07,360
And now when you double click inside of here you can still use these notes to edit and clean up the

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,600
pads here.

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,650
Now you'll find a basic text tool and this is where you can add different text so you can add a navigation

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,800
for example.

41
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,930
And another thing you can do with the text tool is instead of clicking to add some text you can click

42
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,670
and drag to create a bounding box that your text is going to wrap and live inside of.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Next we have the comment tool and this comment tool is really powerful because you can share your designs

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,080
with anybody on the web.

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,650
They don't have to install anything.

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,500
And they can quickly jump in and start commenting on your designs here so they can click on any area

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,640
here and say this circle needs some color.

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,070
And as soon as they click post I'll be notified of that and I can have a conversation directly in here

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,670
and I can hover over this to refer back to this conversation.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,760
And now if I ever add some color I can just click this resolve and it'll archive that conversation so

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,630
I don't need to see it unless I pull up my archived conversation.

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,820
So it's really nice.

53
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,750
Now this center area right here is only showing the name of the file right now which is untitled.

54
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,880
This is where you can rename your file and you can also jump into version history to see what's been

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
going on through different versions.

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,610
So if I click Show version history you can see what it looks like at 4:16 p.m. or the current version

57
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,740
and I haven't done much in here so there's not many versions but this is where you'll find five 10 or

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,310
15 different versions throughout the last 30 days.

59
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,920
Now if I click back to editing here I can click back on this dropdown arrow.

60
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,890
I can duplicate this file.

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,300
I can delete this or jump back into my files or move this file to a certain project.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,880
So that's where you'll find the controls for your file.

63
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,390
But watch what happens when I click on the circle.

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,020
All of a sudden I have some contextual options that allow me to edit this circle specifically.

65
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,110
So if you hover over this this is the option for editing an object so that click inside of here it will

66
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,990
show me the nodes and here's where I can drag some of these nodes around and edit the object.

67
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,500
I can click done here or I can reset the instance.

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,050
Now this is greyed out because this only applies to components which we're going to talk about later.

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,070
But let's say I create a component here and this component is created I'm going to just hold down option

70
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,250
and copy this master component and that creates a child component.

71
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,260
And again I'm going to talk more about how this works in a later video.

72
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,520
But now let's say I choose this card to be read and I choose this color it should be blue.

73
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,220
Well because this is a child component of this Master component I can click inside of here and I can

74
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,910
say I want to reset this instance to match the master component and that's what that does here.

75
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,620
Now if you want to mask any shapes with any other shapes or mask a shape with an image you can do this

76
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,110
here and I'll show you how this works by adding an image real quick and we'll mask that with this shape

77
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,540
here so we can go into the shapes tool click on place image.

78
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,470
And now if you visit the assets folder under the exorcized files you can click on any one of these images

79
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,930
or just find an image on your computer to upload here.

80
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,680
It doesn't matter which image.

81
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,070
So I'm going to click Open and now it's going to ask me where I want to place this and watch this if

82
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,730
I hover over this circle it will place the image and mask it inside of here or here or this shape.

83
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,830
But to maintain some masking control what I'm going to do is just click outside of any of these and

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,610
just click somewhere out of the canvas randomly.

85
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,370
And now that we have this image in place I can click on the image and resize this holding down shift

86
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,100
and I can resize it to fit somewhat within this rectangle behind it and I'm going to hold down Z and

87
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,430
drag a rectangle to zoom in here and zoom in I can select this rectangle hold down shift and select

88
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,530
the image.

89
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:07,630
And now I can click on this use as a mask tool and now this rectangle behind the image is purely a mask

90
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,690
that's masking the image above this so I can still click on this image layer.

91
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,200
I can do some resizing within here and move it around to exactly where I want and it will always be

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,630
masked within this rectangle.

93
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,130
Now I want to show you the bully on tool and in order to do that I'm just going to select everything

94
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,530
that I have here and just hit delete.

95
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,490
And here I'm just going to zoom in holding down the Z key and I'll just drag a rectangle right here.

96
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:43,960
And now I can add some different shapes here like a rectangle and a circle and now I'm going to change

97
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,450
the color of this one so you can kind of see which ones on top of each other.

98
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,860
Now using this bully on tool or this union selection I can select two of these shapes here and I can

99
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,880
click Union.

100
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,760
And that creates one shape where I can change the color of this one shape I can manipulate this as if

101
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
it's one.

102
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,390
But this bully on effect creates icons that are nondestructive so I can still double click inside of

103
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,990
here and I can move this around and manipulate this shape too.

104
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,430
For example be wider and centered within this square.

105
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,600
So you see you can create some great shapes using some simple squares and circles.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,810
Now if I right click and ungroup here that will undo that change that I made and I can still select

107
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,930
both of these.

108
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,930
And here I can choose to subtract the one that's in front from the one that's behind.

109
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,980
And so now you can see that it kind of behaves as a cookie cutter holding down commands Z.

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,670
I can undo this.

111
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,940
And now I can intersect the selection so anything that's intersected in between these two shapes is

112
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,600
going to keep and excluding the selection retains the shape above here and the shape down here and anything

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,540
that's intersecting it kind of just subtracts that.

114
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,240
Now you've seen so far that we have nondestructive editing where I can still move this around and it

115
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,020
still retains the exclude feature but what happens if I want to bake this in now and do some further

116
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,720
editing.

117
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,830
So this acts like one image.

118
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,380
It is two different shapes.

119
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,210
I can go in here after I've edited everything and combined my shapes I can choose to flatten selection

120
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,080
and what that does now is as this is one single shape.

121
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,540
So now when I double click inside of here you can see that I can edit the nodes inside of here and now

122
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,270
I can't just grab this circle and move it like I was able to.

123
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,350
But now I'm able to do some more advanced techniques to kind of tweak the shape that I want.

124
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,050
The last one I want to show you is the crop image.

125
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,030
So again I'm going to go into the shapes tool click on place image and I'll grab one of these shapes

126
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:59,900
again and once I placed this here I can place it like I have before or I can click and drag a rectangle

127
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,230
and I can drag this to be the size that I want rather than just clicking in place as the original size.

128
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,200
So now I can click on this Krop image here and it gives me these nice crop marks where I can choose

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,750
to compose this image in whatever kind of frame that I want.

130
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,020
And once I hit return that's now cropped.

131
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,370
Now if I double click inside of here I can do that same masking technique.

132
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,200
And if I resize this a kind of skews the image within this cropped area.

133
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,660
Now those are all the object menus.

134
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,980
And lastly to the right we can see more options in the tools panel.

135
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,980
One of them is it's showing my named Caleb here because I'm actually logged in with two computers so

136
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,400
even though I'm using my same account if I'm logged in twice it'll show hey Caleb's here and another

137
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,640
computer too.

138
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,580
So if you have three or four or five people working on this project you're going to see those three

139
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,700
four or five icons here and you can click on one of those icons to actually see the other users mouse

140
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,000
and follow where they're designing.

141
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,690
Now if you want to share this project with anybody else you can click the share icon and you can share

142
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:12,020
this by just copying a link or even embedding a code inside of a blog for people to interact with your

143
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,840
designs within a blog like Wordpress.

144
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,300
Now we'll talk a little bit more about the present feature in a prototype video.

145
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:24,050
But if I click on this I get a nice preview of my design and if I've prototyped this I can click through

146
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,900
to interact with my design.

147
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,010
You can see that this present mode actually opens up in a new tab here so I can still toggle back and

148
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,720
edit a few things like move this over and jump back into the present mode and see that that changes

149
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,700
live.

150
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,690
Or I can just close it this way and jump back into it at any time here if I want to jump into my view

151
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,140
settings.

152
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,820
I can choose to toggle some pixel preview pixel grid layout grids.

153
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,890
So these are a few quick view options that you'll get here in the View menu as well and to the right

154
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,830
it shows you a few shortcuts to toggle these views on and off.

155
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,000
Now if you don't want to hold down Z to draw a rectangle to zoom in a certain area or if you don't want

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,310
to hold down command to zoom in and out you can choose some precise zoom controls by clicking on this

157
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,610
arrow here and jumping to 0 percent or 50 percent.

158
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,750
And there's also some short cuts here that you can use like the equal sign or the subtract sign to zoom

159
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,390
in and out.

160
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,540
Or if you want to zoom to fit you just tap 1 or 0 for 100 percent.

161
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,390
The last tool in the Tools panel is this export assets tool and you can see that it shows 0 out of 0

162
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,020
selected that I can't export anything.

163
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,460
And that's because before you export anything you have to actually select these objects and make them

164
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,670
exportable and decide what format you want to export them in.

165
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,560
So now that I clicked on that to make exportable let's say we have two or three or four different objects

166
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,370
I'm just going to add another circle here and I'll make this exportable as well.

167
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,280
So you have to exportable objects now and you can click on this export and you can see these two layers

168
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,870
and it's going to export both of them as a PMG.

169
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,090
Now you don't have the option to name these objects that are being exported in the export panel but

170
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,730
if you want this file to be named something differently you can click on it here and just double click

171
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,110
to change the name right here and you can name this cake.

172
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,960
For example you jump back in here you can see that that's named differently.
