WEBVTT

00:01.170 --> 00:06.100
To show you the tools panel I'm going to start off with a fresh new project so to follow along.

00:06.330 --> 00:11.130
Just start a new project and we can just work our way from there the first time I'm going to do in the

00:11.130 --> 00:19.410
Tools menu is create a new frame and this frame tool is used to create new art boards and also to frame

00:19.410 --> 00:26.720
certain sections like a navigation menu bar or an iPhone navigation footer to start off.

00:26.720 --> 00:31.370
You can see here on the right we have different presets for frames that we want to create.

00:31.370 --> 00:36.900
So I can create an iPhone X frame for example here and I can just click on that and it'll plop that

00:36.900 --> 00:43.860
directly in the canvas or if I click on this frame tool I can drag and create a custom frame size at

00:43.860 --> 00:45.720
whatever size that I want.

00:45.810 --> 00:50.880
I'm going to delete this frame and let's just keep this iPhone X frame as we move along.

00:51.060 --> 00:55.600
Now to select any objects you have this move tool this move and select.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.000
So now I can click on the name of this frame and I can move it.

00:59.070 --> 01:03.360
Now I want to create a few shapes So here's where you'll find your shapes.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.720
I can quickly draw some rectangles here.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.370
And if I click on this dropdown arrow I have more shape options so here I can draw an ellipse and I

01:12.370 --> 01:18.550
can hold down shift to constrain this proportionately and I'll just drag this around.

01:19.850 --> 01:26.450
And we have a few of these other one star tool polygon and you lips I'll just place these ones for now.

01:26.450 --> 01:32.000
Now I can also scale these objects if I have this circle for example I can click on this down arrow

01:32.000 --> 01:38.540
next to the move tool and I can click on the scale tool and I can just drag any one of these drag handles

01:38.540 --> 01:41.900
and scale this down or up as I see fit.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.070
Now those are great for simple shapes and I'm going to just select both of these and drag them up a

01:46.070 --> 01:46.620
little bit.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.150
But I can also create custom shapes using this pen tool.

01:50.600 --> 01:57.890
For example if I want to quickly create a shape of a heart let's say I can do that here and I'll show

01:57.890 --> 02:02.000
you more how to use these controls to create your own shapes.

02:02.150 --> 02:06.970
I'm just drawing something quick to show you where these tools live and kind of how they work.

02:07.190 --> 02:12.600
And you can see here when we're inside the pen tool we have other options here too.

02:12.860 --> 02:21.740
So we can use this paint bucket tool for example to click and paint a certain color inside of that stroke

02:21.740 --> 02:29.720
or that shape and we can also use this bend tool to select certain nodes and bend the shape.

02:29.720 --> 02:35.960
If you want to design something more freeform like a signature for example you can use this down arrow

02:36.380 --> 02:38.070
and select the pencil tool.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.590
But before I do that I'm just going to click done here because I don't want to create the same shape

02:42.650 --> 02:45.260
inside of this that instance.

02:45.290 --> 02:50.120
So now I'm going to click on this down arrow and click on the pencil tool.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.630
And here's where I can create a quick signature.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.630
And I'm using a mouse so it's kind of messy.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.310
But you can see how freeform that is.

02:59.350 --> 03:07.360
And now when you double click inside of here you can still use these notes to edit and clean up the

03:07.360 --> 03:08.600
pads here.

03:08.710 --> 03:14.650
Now you'll find a basic text tool and this is where you can add different text so you can add a navigation

03:15.370 --> 03:16.800
for example.

03:16.910 --> 03:22.930
And another thing you can do with the text tool is instead of clicking to add some text you can click

03:22.930 --> 03:28.670
and drag to create a bounding box that your text is going to wrap and live inside of.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.640
Next we have the comment tool and this comment tool is really powerful because you can share your designs

03:33.640 --> 03:35.080
with anybody on the web.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.650
They don't have to install anything.

03:36.850 --> 03:41.500
And they can quickly jump in and start commenting on your designs here so they can click on any area

03:41.500 --> 03:47.640
here and say this circle needs some color.

03:48.220 --> 03:54.070
And as soon as they click post I'll be notified of that and I can have a conversation directly in here

03:54.100 --> 03:58.670
and I can hover over this to refer back to this conversation.

03:58.840 --> 04:03.760
And now if I ever add some color I can just click this resolve and it'll archive that conversation so

04:03.760 --> 04:07.630
I don't need to see it unless I pull up my archived conversation.

04:07.630 --> 04:08.820
So it's really nice.

04:08.830 --> 04:13.750
Now this center area right here is only showing the name of the file right now which is untitled.

04:14.110 --> 04:18.880
This is where you can rename your file and you can also jump into version history to see what's been

04:18.880 --> 04:20.960
going on through different versions.

04:20.980 --> 04:27.610
So if I click Show version history you can see what it looks like at 4:16 p.m. or the current version

04:27.990 --> 04:32.740
and I haven't done much in here so there's not many versions but this is where you'll find five 10 or

04:32.740 --> 04:36.310
15 different versions throughout the last 30 days.

04:36.310 --> 04:40.920
Now if I click back to editing here I can click back on this dropdown arrow.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.890
I can duplicate this file.

04:42.940 --> 04:49.300
I can delete this or jump back into my files or move this file to a certain project.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.880
So that's where you'll find the controls for your file.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.390
But watch what happens when I click on the circle.

04:54.640 --> 05:00.020
All of a sudden I have some contextual options that allow me to edit this circle specifically.

05:00.100 --> 05:05.110
So if you hover over this this is the option for editing an object so that click inside of here it will

05:05.110 --> 05:09.990
show me the nodes and here's where I can drag some of these nodes around and edit the object.

05:10.090 --> 05:14.500
I can click done here or I can reset the instance.

05:14.500 --> 05:19.050
Now this is greyed out because this only applies to components which we're going to talk about later.

05:19.240 --> 05:27.070
But let's say I create a component here and this component is created I'm going to just hold down option

05:27.550 --> 05:31.250
and copy this master component and that creates a child component.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.260
And again I'm going to talk more about how this works in a later video.

05:35.380 --> 05:43.520
But now let's say I choose this card to be read and I choose this color it should be blue.

05:43.930 --> 05:50.220
Well because this is a child component of this Master component I can click inside of here and I can

05:50.220 --> 05:55.910
say I want to reset this instance to match the master component and that's what that does here.

05:55.950 --> 06:01.620
Now if you want to mask any shapes with any other shapes or mask a shape with an image you can do this

06:01.620 --> 06:07.110
here and I'll show you how this works by adding an image real quick and we'll mask that with this shape

06:07.110 --> 06:11.540
here so we can go into the shapes tool click on place image.

06:11.670 --> 06:16.470
And now if you visit the assets folder under the exorcized files you can click on any one of these images

06:16.860 --> 06:19.930
or just find an image on your computer to upload here.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.680
It doesn't matter which image.

06:21.700 --> 06:26.070
So I'm going to click Open and now it's going to ask me where I want to place this and watch this if

06:26.070 --> 06:32.730
I hover over this circle it will place the image and mask it inside of here or here or this shape.

06:32.980 --> 06:37.830
But to maintain some masking control what I'm going to do is just click outside of any of these and

06:37.830 --> 06:41.610
just click somewhere out of the canvas randomly.

06:41.610 --> 06:47.370
And now that we have this image in place I can click on the image and resize this holding down shift

06:47.530 --> 06:53.100
and I can resize it to fit somewhat within this rectangle behind it and I'm going to hold down Z and

06:53.100 --> 06:59.430
drag a rectangle to zoom in here and zoom in I can select this rectangle hold down shift and select

06:59.430 --> 07:00.530
the image.

07:00.690 --> 07:07.630
And now I can click on this use as a mask tool and now this rectangle behind the image is purely a mask

07:07.650 --> 07:12.690
that's masking the image above this so I can still click on this image layer.

07:12.690 --> 07:19.200
I can do some resizing within here and move it around to exactly where I want and it will always be

07:19.200 --> 07:21.630
masked within this rectangle.

07:21.630 --> 07:26.130
Now I want to show you the bully on tool and in order to do that I'm just going to select everything

07:26.130 --> 07:28.530
that I have here and just hit delete.

07:29.340 --> 07:34.490
And here I'm just going to zoom in holding down the Z key and I'll just drag a rectangle right here.

07:35.250 --> 07:43.960
And now I can add some different shapes here like a rectangle and a circle and now I'm going to change

07:43.960 --> 07:49.450
the color of this one so you can kind of see which ones on top of each other.

07:49.480 --> 07:56.860
Now using this bully on tool or this union selection I can select two of these shapes here and I can

07:56.860 --> 07:57.880
click Union.

07:58.150 --> 08:03.760
And that creates one shape where I can change the color of this one shape I can manipulate this as if

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
it's one.

08:05.260 --> 08:10.390
But this bully on effect creates icons that are nondestructive so I can still double click inside of

08:10.390 --> 08:14.990
here and I can move this around and manipulate this shape too.

08:15.130 --> 08:21.430
For example be wider and centered within this square.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.600
So you see you can create some great shapes using some simple squares and circles.

08:26.600 --> 08:32.810
Now if I right click and ungroup here that will undo that change that I made and I can still select

08:32.810 --> 08:33.930
both of these.

08:34.010 --> 08:38.930
And here I can choose to subtract the one that's in front from the one that's behind.

08:39.110 --> 08:43.980
And so now you can see that it kind of behaves as a cookie cutter holding down commands Z.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.670
I can undo this.

08:46.130 --> 08:52.940
And now I can intersect the selection so anything that's intersected in between these two shapes is

08:52.940 --> 08:59.600
going to keep and excluding the selection retains the shape above here and the shape down here and anything

08:59.600 --> 09:02.540
that's intersecting it kind of just subtracts that.

09:02.540 --> 09:08.240
Now you've seen so far that we have nondestructive editing where I can still move this around and it

09:08.240 --> 09:15.020
still retains the exclude feature but what happens if I want to bake this in now and do some further

09:15.020 --> 09:15.720
editing.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.830
So this acts like one image.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.380
It is two different shapes.

09:19.580 --> 09:26.210
I can go in here after I've edited everything and combined my shapes I can choose to flatten selection

09:27.230 --> 09:30.080
and what that does now is as this is one single shape.

09:30.080 --> 09:35.540
So now when I double click inside of here you can see that I can edit the nodes inside of here and now

09:35.540 --> 09:39.270
I can't just grab this circle and move it like I was able to.

09:39.290 --> 09:45.350
But now I'm able to do some more advanced techniques to kind of tweak the shape that I want.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.050
The last one I want to show you is the crop image.

09:48.080 --> 09:53.030
So again I'm going to go into the shapes tool click on place image and I'll grab one of these shapes

09:53.030 --> 09:59.900
again and once I placed this here I can place it like I have before or I can click and drag a rectangle

09:59.900 --> 10:06.230
and I can drag this to be the size that I want rather than just clicking in place as the original size.

10:06.260 --> 10:12.200
So now I can click on this Krop image here and it gives me these nice crop marks where I can choose

10:12.200 --> 10:15.750
to compose this image in whatever kind of frame that I want.

10:15.980 --> 10:20.020
And once I hit return that's now cropped.

10:20.030 --> 10:24.370
Now if I double click inside of here I can do that same masking technique.

10:24.590 --> 10:29.200
And if I resize this a kind of skews the image within this cropped area.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.660
Now those are all the object menus.

10:31.850 --> 10:34.980
And lastly to the right we can see more options in the tools panel.

10:35.060 --> 10:39.980
One of them is it's showing my named Caleb here because I'm actually logged in with two computers so

10:40.010 --> 10:46.400
even though I'm using my same account if I'm logged in twice it'll show hey Caleb's here and another

10:46.400 --> 10:47.640
computer too.

10:47.690 --> 10:52.580
So if you have three or four or five people working on this project you're going to see those three

10:52.580 --> 10:58.700
four or five icons here and you can click on one of those icons to actually see the other users mouse

10:58.700 --> 11:01.000
and follow where they're designing.

11:01.190 --> 11:05.690
Now if you want to share this project with anybody else you can click the share icon and you can share

11:05.690 --> 11:12.020
this by just copying a link or even embedding a code inside of a blog for people to interact with your

11:12.020 --> 11:14.840
designs within a blog like Wordpress.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.300
Now we'll talk a little bit more about the present feature in a prototype video.

11:18.410 --> 11:24.050
But if I click on this I get a nice preview of my design and if I've prototyped this I can click through

11:24.050 --> 11:25.900
to interact with my design.

11:26.060 --> 11:31.010
You can see that this present mode actually opens up in a new tab here so I can still toggle back and

11:31.040 --> 11:35.720
edit a few things like move this over and jump back into the present mode and see that that changes

11:35.720 --> 11:36.700
live.

11:36.710 --> 11:41.690
Or I can just close it this way and jump back into it at any time here if I want to jump into my view

11:41.690 --> 11:42.140
settings.

11:42.170 --> 11:47.820
I can choose to toggle some pixel preview pixel grid layout grids.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.890
So these are a few quick view options that you'll get here in the View menu as well and to the right

11:52.890 --> 11:56.830
it shows you a few shortcuts to toggle these views on and off.

11:56.840 --> 12:02.000
Now if you don't want to hold down Z to draw a rectangle to zoom in a certain area or if you don't want

12:02.000 --> 12:07.310
to hold down command to zoom in and out you can choose some precise zoom controls by clicking on this

12:07.310 --> 12:11.610
arrow here and jumping to 0 percent or 50 percent.

12:11.660 --> 12:17.750
And there's also some short cuts here that you can use like the equal sign or the subtract sign to zoom

12:17.750 --> 12:18.390
in and out.

12:18.410 --> 12:23.540
Or if you want to zoom to fit you just tap 1 or 0 for 100 percent.

12:23.540 --> 12:29.390
The last tool in the Tools panel is this export assets tool and you can see that it shows 0 out of 0

12:29.390 --> 12:32.020
selected that I can't export anything.

12:32.090 --> 12:37.460
And that's because before you export anything you have to actually select these objects and make them

12:37.460 --> 12:41.670
exportable and decide what format you want to export them in.

12:41.690 --> 12:47.560
So now that I clicked on that to make exportable let's say we have two or three or four different objects

12:47.570 --> 12:52.370
I'm just going to add another circle here and I'll make this exportable as well.

12:52.370 --> 12:58.280
So you have to exportable objects now and you can click on this export and you can see these two layers

12:58.600 --> 13:01.870
and it's going to export both of them as a PMG.

13:01.880 --> 13:08.090
Now you don't have the option to name these objects that are being exported in the export panel but

13:08.090 --> 13:13.730
if you want this file to be named something differently you can click on it here and just double click

13:13.730 --> 13:17.110
to change the name right here and you can name this cake.

13:17.150 --> 13:20.960
For example you jump back in here you can see that that's named differently.
