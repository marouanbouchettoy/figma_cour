1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,140
Talk you through the pages and layers panel let's open up this pages layer's file that you can find

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,260
in the exercise folder under Chapter 2.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,960
And first off if you don't see this layer's panel it may be hidden so you can go in the View menu and

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,490
show layer's panel right here and this will toggle the layers panel on and off.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,740
Now to show you this layer's panel I just want to hold down the Zeek and I'll draw a rectangle under

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,160
this log in page here just to zoom in a little bit.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,110
And you can see first of all if you hover over different layers you can see that those layers are shown

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,650
in the canvas as well in blue.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,340
And each layer has an icon here to the left of it to indicate what this layer is for.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,790
So for example this text layer is a group of all of these text objects here and that's indicated by

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,040
a dashed line.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,600
And then we also have frames.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,680
So the log in page home page menu.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,040
These are all frames that group the objects inside of this device preview.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,050
Now frames can also be inside of frames.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,610
For example if you click on this your art museum frame here we can see that this is app info that's

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,930
inside of the log in page frame.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,890
And one nice thing with working with Sigma is for example by click outside of this frame here and I

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,520
go into this home frame let's scroll over and I can click on Masters old and new as soon as I do that

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,860
then everything drops down and expands to show me these objects within this frame itself.

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,790
Now if you want to keep things clean after you're done working with for example the home frame you can

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,200
click on this little arrow and it'll collapse all of the layers underneath this home frame.

23
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,100
And so you can collapse and expand anything that's grouped like frames.

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,700
This is a component here.

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:59,430
And groups now Master components are what you can use to create a design and reuse it throughout your

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,370
project.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,970
And we'll talk about that more in a future video.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,120
But this behaves much like a group as well where you'll have objects underneath this master component.

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,160
Now within any of these layers like this app info layer you can click and drag this down throughout

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,500
the hierarchy to move this down in the layers panel.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,920
So right now this is behind the background image.

32
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,830
And so I can move this down or move this back up where it belongs where you can see this.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,480
You can also move layers onto different art boards or frames by clicking and holding if you hold then

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,590
it'll expand the layers underneath this frame and I can click and let go.

35
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,970
And now this is inside of another layer.

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:52,170
I'm going to click command z a few times to undo this and now another thing that you get with layers

37
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:58,080
if you write clicks you have a number of different menu items to manipulate these layers so you can

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,300
send them forward and back in the later scheme.

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,820
You can group certain selections if you select multiple layers you have the option to show and hide

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,150
a layer or lock and unlock where you can flip them or copy and paste certain styles.

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,670
Now to show and hide or lock and unlock layers you also have some icons here if you hover over any layer

42
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,710
you can quickly click this lock icon.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,520
And now if I click anywhere within this area I'm not able to select this.

44
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,070
Your art museum layer but I can select any layers underneath this.

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,980
So it's a great feature if you still want to see the objects in front of other objects but you want

46
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,550
to reach out to the elements behind to interact with them.

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:47,740
You can also toggle this icon to hide your layers and if you do hide this layer you can still expand

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,990
this layer and you can see that there are some nested layers here that are also hidden and that's indicated

49
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:00,040
by this door saying I'm adopting the same hidden property that you have applied to the parent layer

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,710
so working with layers is really great.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,810
But what happens when you have a lot of frames and a lot of layers within one page.

52
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,590
Well we have the pages panel as well this shows page one here and there's only one page right now in

53
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,010
this project.

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,760
And I can show you how pages works.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,950
If I hit the one key I'm going to zoom out here to show all of these art boards and let's say I want

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,130
to organize some of these boards in different pages.

57
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,530
So if I want to do that I can click on this page one here and you can see that I get a little dropdown

58
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,430
to create a new page.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,210
So I'm going to create a page called collections.

60
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,800
And now to go back to page 1 I can select any frame that I want or any objects that I want and if I

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,750
right click I can move this to the page collections.

62
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:56,900
I can also just command X here and go into the collections page and command V for a quick cut and paste

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,150
or copy and paste in between pages.

64
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,110
Now one really nice way that I like to use pages is I always create a page within my project called

65
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:15,760
archive land and I use this archive land page for different designs that I might want to archive but

66
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,170
aren't necessarily a part of the current design.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,370
For example if I hold the key and zoom into this home frame here and I'll hold down a command and just

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,190
scroll down just so I can see a little bit above here too I can click on this home frame and hold down

69
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,800
option and if I hold down option I can drag this up to create a copy.

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,780
And now I can make a number of changes to this and if I like this change I want to commit to this I

71
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,970
can save this in my current design but to keep this page clean I can just right click here and move

72
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,500
this to archive land.

73
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,600
And I know that I have access if I want to refer to that later but I can commit this frame to my current

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,130
design.
