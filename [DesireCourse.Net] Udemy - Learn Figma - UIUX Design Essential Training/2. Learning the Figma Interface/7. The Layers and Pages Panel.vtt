00:01.920 --> 00:07.140
Talk you through the pages and layers panel let's open up this pages layer's file that you can find

00:07.140 --> 00:10.260
in the exercise folder under Chapter 2.

00:10.440 --> 00:15.960
And first off if you don't see this layer's panel it may be hidden so you can go in the View menu and

00:15.960 --> 00:21.490
show layer's panel right here and this will toggle the layers panel on and off.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.740
Now to show you this layer's panel I just want to hold down the Zeek and I'll draw a rectangle under

00:25.740 --> 00:29.160
this log in page here just to zoom in a little bit.

00:30.500 --> 00:36.110
And you can see first of all if you hover over different layers you can see that those layers are shown

00:36.260 --> 00:38.650
in the canvas as well in blue.

00:38.780 --> 00:43.340
And each layer has an icon here to the left of it to indicate what this layer is for.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.790
So for example this text layer is a group of all of these text objects here and that's indicated by

00:49.790 --> 00:52.040
a dashed line.

00:52.230 --> 00:53.600
And then we also have frames.

00:53.610 --> 00:56.680
So the log in page home page menu.

00:56.820 --> 01:02.040
These are all frames that group the objects inside of this device preview.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.050
Now frames can also be inside of frames.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.610
For example if you click on this your art museum frame here we can see that this is app info that's

01:11.610 --> 01:13.930
inside of the log in page frame.

01:14.160 --> 01:19.890
And one nice thing with working with Sigma is for example by click outside of this frame here and I

01:19.890 --> 01:26.520
go into this home frame let's scroll over and I can click on Masters old and new as soon as I do that

01:26.610 --> 01:32.860
then everything drops down and expands to show me these objects within this frame itself.

01:33.270 --> 01:38.790
Now if you want to keep things clean after you're done working with for example the home frame you can

01:38.790 --> 01:44.200
click on this little arrow and it'll collapse all of the layers underneath this home frame.

01:44.550 --> 01:49.100
And so you can collapse and expand anything that's grouped like frames.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.700
This is a component here.

01:51.090 --> 01:59.430
And groups now Master components are what you can use to create a design and reuse it throughout your

01:59.430 --> 02:00.370
project.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.970
And we'll talk about that more in a future video.

02:03.120 --> 02:09.120
But this behaves much like a group as well where you'll have objects underneath this master component.

02:10.890 --> 02:17.160
Now within any of these layers like this app info layer you can click and drag this down throughout

02:17.160 --> 02:20.500
the hierarchy to move this down in the layers panel.

02:20.520 --> 02:24.920
So right now this is behind the background image.

02:25.170 --> 02:29.830
And so I can move this down or move this back up where it belongs where you can see this.

02:29.880 --> 02:36.480
You can also move layers onto different art boards or frames by clicking and holding if you hold then

02:36.480 --> 02:41.590
it'll expand the layers underneath this frame and I can click and let go.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.970
And now this is inside of another layer.

02:45.190 --> 02:52.170
I'm going to click command z a few times to undo this and now another thing that you get with layers

02:52.170 --> 02:58.080
if you write clicks you have a number of different menu items to manipulate these layers so you can

02:58.080 --> 03:00.300
send them forward and back in the later scheme.

03:01.590 --> 03:06.820
You can group certain selections if you select multiple layers you have the option to show and hide

03:06.820 --> 03:12.150
a layer or lock and unlock where you can flip them or copy and paste certain styles.

03:12.220 --> 03:18.670
Now to show and hide or lock and unlock layers you also have some icons here if you hover over any layer

03:19.150 --> 03:21.710
you can quickly click this lock icon.

03:21.820 --> 03:26.520
And now if I click anywhere within this area I'm not able to select this.

03:26.530 --> 03:31.070
Your art museum layer but I can select any layers underneath this.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.980
So it's a great feature if you still want to see the objects in front of other objects but you want

03:35.980 --> 03:39.550
to reach out to the elements behind to interact with them.

03:39.550 --> 03:47.740
You can also toggle this icon to hide your layers and if you do hide this layer you can still expand

03:47.770 --> 03:52.990
this layer and you can see that there are some nested layers here that are also hidden and that's indicated

03:52.990 --> 04:00.040
by this door saying I'm adopting the same hidden property that you have applied to the parent layer

04:01.040 --> 04:03.710
so working with layers is really great.

04:03.710 --> 04:08.810
But what happens when you have a lot of frames and a lot of layers within one page.

04:08.810 --> 04:15.590
Well we have the pages panel as well this shows page one here and there's only one page right now in

04:15.590 --> 04:17.010
this project.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.760
And I can show you how pages works.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.950
If I hit the one key I'm going to zoom out here to show all of these art boards and let's say I want

04:24.950 --> 04:28.130
to organize some of these boards in different pages.

04:28.340 --> 04:33.530
So if I want to do that I can click on this page one here and you can see that I get a little dropdown

04:33.650 --> 04:35.430
to create a new page.

04:35.630 --> 04:39.210
So I'm going to create a page called collections.

04:39.830 --> 04:45.800
And now to go back to page 1 I can select any frame that I want or any objects that I want and if I

04:45.800 --> 04:49.750
right click I can move this to the page collections.

04:49.790 --> 04:56.900
I can also just command X here and go into the collections page and command V for a quick cut and paste

04:56.900 --> 04:59.150
or copy and paste in between pages.

04:59.150 --> 05:06.110
Now one really nice way that I like to use pages is I always create a page within my project called

05:06.110 --> 05:15.760
archive land and I use this archive land page for different designs that I might want to archive but

05:15.760 --> 05:18.170
aren't necessarily a part of the current design.

05:18.920 --> 05:25.370
For example if I hold the key and zoom into this home frame here and I'll hold down a command and just

05:25.370 --> 05:31.190
scroll down just so I can see a little bit above here too I can click on this home frame and hold down

05:31.190 --> 05:36.800
option and if I hold down option I can drag this up to create a copy.

05:36.800 --> 05:41.780
And now I can make a number of changes to this and if I like this change I want to commit to this I

05:41.780 --> 05:46.970
can save this in my current design but to keep this page clean I can just right click here and move

05:46.970 --> 05:48.500
this to archive land.

05:48.500 --> 05:53.600
And I know that I have access if I want to refer to that later but I can commit this frame to my current

05:53.600 --> 05:54.130
design.
