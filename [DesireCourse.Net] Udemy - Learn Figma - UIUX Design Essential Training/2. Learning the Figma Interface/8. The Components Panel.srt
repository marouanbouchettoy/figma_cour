00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,270
To show you how the components panel works let's open up this component's panel fig project and you

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,450
can find that in the exercise files under Chapter 2 in this project we have three simple layers.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,320
We have a rectangle.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,510
We have an Add button and a heart button and now we can find the components panel here right next to

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,870
the layers panel.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,160
If we click down here we can see that there are any components created yet.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,560
And they're telling us to create a component select a layer and click that create component button in

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,760
the toolbar.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,670
So these are simple layers right now but I can easily click on this layer and click Create component.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,910
I can click on this heart create component and now we have two components here and with these components

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,450
we can simply drag and drop these on other frames to reuse these components throughout other parts of

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,610
the project.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,820
And the really nice thing about this is if we ever go into the master component we can change the color.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,640
For example the blue and it changes everywhere throughout our project.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,660
Now another great way to use components is inside other components.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,940
Saw right here we have two master components and we can tell their master components by this little

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,840
icon here on the top left of their name.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,450
They have four little diamonds indicating that this is the master.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,490
But now I can click on this and if I hold down option I can drag this over into this navigation bar

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,900
that I'm going to create to be another master component.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,700
And so I can copy this component inside of here or I can go into the components panel and I can drag

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:43,920
for example this heart drag this inside of this nav bar here and now we have these two components inside

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,450
of this navigation bar.

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,740
Now the last thing I'm going to do is click and drag a rectangle around all three of these objects and

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,020
I'll click one more time create component and now we have a nav bar component.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,890
So if I want to hold down option I can copy this or Again I can click in this component panel and copy

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,390
this on to other frames.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,600
And before I move any further I'm just going to delete some of these extra objects here and I'm going

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,410
to hold down option and now and copy this frame over to the right.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,250
So now we have three frames that have the same components inside of them.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,570
We very easily created these three components.

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,430
And so now within seconds I can change the look of this nav bar by double clicking inside of here to

33
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,910
get to this rectangle.

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,710
I can decide where I want this nav bar to be blue now and I actually want these to be white.

35
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,470
So I'm going to double click inside of here make this white and as I'm making these changes even as

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm selecting the color within here you can see that this is gradually changing within all of the child

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,130
components.

38
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,520
So these are just some of the basic ways that you can create components and they become really powerful

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
but you can always find these components inside of this components panel.

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,770
And if you want to use these components through throughout other projects you can very easily publish

41
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,190
these files to a library to reuse in other projects.

42
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,690
That isn't even in this component's panel Sigma project.

43
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:23,230
Now one thing you have to be careful of is because these are master components right here.

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,820
If I delete this master component it's going to be deleted in the components panel as well.

45
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,120
And now I don't have that same kind of power if I double click into this component here.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,600
I can still change the color of this heart.

47
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,710
And it changes red everywhere else but it's not because of this component we created before it's because

48
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,610
it's living inside of this component that I'm editing.

49
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,470
So that's just a basic overview of how components works.

50
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,020
Just to show you this components panel and where you can organize your components here and reuse them

51
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,350
throughout your project.
