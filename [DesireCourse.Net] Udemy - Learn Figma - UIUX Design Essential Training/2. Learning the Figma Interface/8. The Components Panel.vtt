00:00.720 --> 00:06.270
To show you how the components panel works let's open up this component's panel fig project and you

00:06.270 --> 00:12.450
can find that in the exercise files under Chapter 2 in this project we have three simple layers.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.320
We have a rectangle.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.510
We have an Add button and a heart button and now we can find the components panel here right next to

00:18.510 --> 00:19.870
the layers panel.

00:19.890 --> 00:24.160
If we click down here we can see that there are any components created yet.

00:24.210 --> 00:28.560
And they're telling us to create a component select a layer and click that create component button in

00:28.560 --> 00:29.760
the toolbar.

00:29.790 --> 00:35.670
So these are simple layers right now but I can easily click on this layer and click Create component.

00:35.980 --> 00:41.910
I can click on this heart create component and now we have two components here and with these components

00:41.910 --> 00:48.450
we can simply drag and drop these on other frames to reuse these components throughout other parts of

00:48.450 --> 00:49.610
the project.

00:49.910 --> 00:55.820
And the really nice thing about this is if we ever go into the master component we can change the color.

00:55.950 --> 00:59.640
For example the blue and it changes everywhere throughout our project.

01:02.130 --> 01:06.660
Now another great way to use components is inside other components.

01:06.660 --> 01:11.940
Saw right here we have two master components and we can tell their master components by this little

01:11.940 --> 01:14.840
icon here on the top left of their name.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.450
They have four little diamonds indicating that this is the master.

01:18.750 --> 01:26.490
But now I can click on this and if I hold down option I can drag this over into this navigation bar

01:26.490 --> 01:29.900
that I'm going to create to be another master component.

01:30.090 --> 01:35.700
And so I can copy this component inside of here or I can go into the components panel and I can drag

01:35.730 --> 01:43.920
for example this heart drag this inside of this nav bar here and now we have these two components inside

01:43.920 --> 01:45.450
of this navigation bar.

01:46.290 --> 01:52.740
Now the last thing I'm going to do is click and drag a rectangle around all three of these objects and

01:52.740 --> 01:59.020
I'll click one more time create component and now we have a nav bar component.

01:59.280 --> 02:07.890
So if I want to hold down option I can copy this or Again I can click in this component panel and copy

02:07.890 --> 02:09.390
this on to other frames.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.600
And before I move any further I'm just going to delete some of these extra objects here and I'm going

02:15.600 --> 02:19.410
to hold down option and now and copy this frame over to the right.

02:19.410 --> 02:23.250
So now we have three frames that have the same components inside of them.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.570
We very easily created these three components.

02:27.640 --> 02:33.430
And so now within seconds I can change the look of this nav bar by double clicking inside of here to

02:33.430 --> 02:34.910
get to this rectangle.

02:34.990 --> 02:41.710
I can decide where I want this nav bar to be blue now and I actually want these to be white.

02:41.710 --> 02:47.470
So I'm going to double click inside of here make this white and as I'm making these changes even as

02:47.470 --> 02:52.840
I'm selecting the color within here you can see that this is gradually changing within all of the child

02:52.840 --> 02:54.130
components.

02:54.130 --> 02:59.520
So these are just some of the basic ways that you can create components and they become really powerful

02:59.680 --> 03:03.840
but you can always find these components inside of this components panel.

03:03.840 --> 03:08.770
And if you want to use these components through throughout other projects you can very easily publish

03:08.770 --> 03:12.190
these files to a library to reuse in other projects.

03:12.190 --> 03:17.690
That isn't even in this component's panel Sigma project.

03:17.710 --> 03:23.230
Now one thing you have to be careful of is because these are master components right here.

03:23.230 --> 03:28.820
If I delete this master component it's going to be deleted in the components panel as well.

03:29.230 --> 03:34.120
And now I don't have that same kind of power if I double click into this component here.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.600
I can still change the color of this heart.

03:37.430 --> 03:42.710
And it changes red everywhere else but it's not because of this component we created before it's because

03:42.710 --> 03:45.610
it's living inside of this component that I'm editing.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.470
So that's just a basic overview of how components works.

03:48.470 --> 03:54.020
Just to show you this components panel and where you can organize your components here and reuse them

03:54.020 --> 03:55.350
throughout your project.
