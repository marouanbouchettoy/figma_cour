1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,300
To show you how Team libraries works I need to first show you how to add a new team into figure.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,460
So down here when the very first start up figure in the start screen we have this new teen icon.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,760
And here you can name your team and if you go through this process there will be options to invite new

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,220
members to the team.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,520
Because I already went through this I'm going to click Cancel and I have enabled a paid account under

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,280
the team brain spin so I can show you this feature.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,140
Now if you're working with the free account you don't have access to the team libraries so you won't

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,660
be able to follow along with me.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,160
But I'll still be able to explain kind of how Team libraries works and how the panels works.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,220
And if you do have a paid subscription plan.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,970
Feel free to just add a team and then click.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:01:00,120
New project here and I'm just going to call this project bootstrap styles and I'll click Create project

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,690
here.

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,560
And once I have this project set up I can import my file here.

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,530
And let's import the bootstrap underscore styles fig file and now we can open up this bootstrap styles

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,810
fig file and we can see a number of buttons that were designed for bootstrap.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,130
So now that we're in a team and we have these buttons designed Let's say you want to use these across

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,860
multiple files and share these designs with the team so they can use these buttons throughout their

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,390
project.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,650
Well first thing I'll do is click on this components panel here we can see that they're not set up as

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,130
a component yet.

22
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,760
So what we would do is click on each of these elements and just click Create component and you can see

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,570
there's a button primary there's a button secondary and just go through here and click on the Create

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,470
component for each of these in the top row.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,270
So now we have these components set up and here we can start with the primary button here.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,730
If I right click I can publish this one component to the team library and if I click on that we can

27
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,300
see that.

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,670
Now this is in the team library section and I can always remove this from the library.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,560
But what does that mean.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,220
Now this is added in a library in the library's panel.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,640
Well I can click down here and I can see that we have this file called Bootstrap styles and by clicking

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,010
here we have that one button we can reuse throughout multiple files.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,430
Well I'll go back here into the components panel and I'll just click this info and I'll add this to

34
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,650
the library.

35
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,000
Well let's just add them all.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,240
So now we have these all added to the library and we can see a little sync icon here saying they've

37
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,200
been added but they haven't been published yet.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,660
So if I go to any other file and try to access these I'm not going to be able to find them so I'll just

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,090
click this publish and it'll give me a view of everything that's going to be added to the library.

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,400
And so I'll click publish changes and now these are all added to the team library.

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,100
So now all I have to do is click on the plus icon to create a whole new file.

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,570
And as I'm designing I can click to create a new frame here and I'll go to a desktop and create a desktop

43
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,170
frame.

44
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,950
And so now there's somebody else on my team may have created and shared those styles.

45
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,000
I can jump here to the team library and jump in to bootstrap styles and say I guess I want this primary

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,680
but I want to use this throughout my project here.

47
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:42,690
So if I hold down option I can copy this three times here and now that I have these inside my file I

48
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,940
can still double click on these and let's click on the layers panel so we can see how these look here.

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,520
So I still see this background.

50
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,810
I can see the text and I can change this text too quick on me.

51
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:06,970
I can resize those and if I want to change the look of this I can click this go to master component

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,080
and it will jump into this project where the master component is.

53
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,810
And here I can double click inside of here to change this to green for example and I can go back into

54
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,540
my project.

55
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,690
And nothing's changed yet.

56
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,380
But if I go back into this bootstrap styles you can see that it's shown here that I've changed the style

57
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,230
but I haven't published the change.

58
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,690
So as soon as I click publish or of any team members click publish then it's going to tell me this is

59
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,420
going to be updated in the library from blue to green so I could publish change here and we'll click

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,590
on untitled and everything is still blue.

61
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,600
But you notice here on the bottom right we have an alert that says component updates available so I

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,250
can click dismiss her review here and I'll click dismiss right now.

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,870
And one thing that's really nice is you're not surprised by some quick changes by team members and you

64
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,930
don't have to adopt those changes that they created.

65
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,920
But if we ever wanted to adopt those changes later we can click on this team library panel here and

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,770
let's kick this back button and we can see that there's one update available.

67
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,880
So click on that update and it will tell me this button primary and bootstrap change to green here.

68
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,000
So I'll decide I want to update this to just click update and now everything's changed to green.

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,300
It still has that blue stroke so I'll go back in here and I'll double click on this again change this

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,160
blue stroke to maybe the same maybe a light green stroke or a dark green stroke.

71
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,250
Let's just do that.

72
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,280
Same thing here publish the change not published we can go back into our other project and we can click

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,250
review immediately this time and update all changes.

74
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:03,020
So the power behind Team libraries is you can have one team member that is designing all of the styles

75
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,200
for a certain project or for multiple projects and at the same time you can have somebody else working

76
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,440
on the project itself adopting those styles dragging them in and applying those.

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,050
And then they can decide whether to adopt changes later as the style grows.

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,330
So it's a great way to reuse styles and elements not just in your project like Master component's allows

79
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,620
but throughout multiple projects and throughout the entire team.
