00:00.510 --> 00:07.300
To show you how Team libraries works I need to first show you how to add a new team into figure.

00:07.710 --> 00:14.460
So down here when the very first start up figure in the start screen we have this new teen icon.

00:14.910 --> 00:20.760
And here you can name your team and if you go through this process there will be options to invite new

00:20.760 --> 00:22.220
members to the team.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.520
Because I already went through this I'm going to click Cancel and I have enabled a paid account under

00:28.520 --> 00:32.280
the team brain spin so I can show you this feature.

00:32.310 --> 00:37.140
Now if you're working with the free account you don't have access to the team libraries so you won't

00:37.140 --> 00:38.660
be able to follow along with me.

00:38.670 --> 00:45.160
But I'll still be able to explain kind of how Team libraries works and how the panels works.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.220
And if you do have a paid subscription plan.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.970
Feel free to just add a team and then click.

00:50.970 --> 01:00.120
New project here and I'm just going to call this project bootstrap styles and I'll click Create project

01:00.120 --> 01:00.690
here.

01:01.630 --> 01:05.560
And once I have this project set up I can import my file here.

01:06.750 --> 01:13.530
And let's import the bootstrap underscore styles fig file and now we can open up this bootstrap styles

01:13.560 --> 01:18.810
fig file and we can see a number of buttons that were designed for bootstrap.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.130
So now that we're in a team and we have these buttons designed Let's say you want to use these across

01:23.130 --> 01:28.860
multiple files and share these designs with the team so they can use these buttons throughout their

01:28.860 --> 01:30.390
project.

01:30.480 --> 01:34.650
Well first thing I'll do is click on this components panel here we can see that they're not set up as

01:34.650 --> 01:36.130
a component yet.

01:36.210 --> 01:41.760
So what we would do is click on each of these elements and just click Create component and you can see

01:41.760 --> 01:48.570
there's a button primary there's a button secondary and just go through here and click on the Create

01:48.570 --> 01:52.470
component for each of these in the top row.

01:53.820 --> 01:59.270
So now we have these components set up and here we can start with the primary button here.

01:59.310 --> 02:05.730
If I right click I can publish this one component to the team library and if I click on that we can

02:05.730 --> 02:06.300
see that.

02:06.300 --> 02:11.670
Now this is in the team library section and I can always remove this from the library.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.560
But what does that mean.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.220
Now this is added in a library in the library's panel.

02:17.700 --> 02:23.640
Well I can click down here and I can see that we have this file called Bootstrap styles and by clicking

02:23.640 --> 02:28.010
here we have that one button we can reuse throughout multiple files.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.430
Well I'll go back here into the components panel and I'll just click this info and I'll add this to

02:35.430 --> 02:36.650
the library.

02:37.050 --> 02:43.000
Well let's just add them all.

02:43.200 --> 02:50.240
So now we have these all added to the library and we can see a little sync icon here saying they've

02:50.250 --> 02:53.200
been added but they haven't been published yet.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.660
So if I go to any other file and try to access these I'm not going to be able to find them so I'll just

02:58.660 --> 03:03.090
click this publish and it'll give me a view of everything that's going to be added to the library.

03:03.130 --> 03:08.400
And so I'll click publish changes and now these are all added to the team library.

03:08.440 --> 03:13.100
So now all I have to do is click on the plus icon to create a whole new file.

03:13.240 --> 03:19.570
And as I'm designing I can click to create a new frame here and I'll go to a desktop and create a desktop

03:19.570 --> 03:20.170
frame.

03:20.170 --> 03:24.950
And so now there's somebody else on my team may have created and shared those styles.

03:25.090 --> 03:31.000
I can jump here to the team library and jump in to bootstrap styles and say I guess I want this primary

03:31.000 --> 03:33.680
but I want to use this throughout my project here.

03:33.910 --> 03:42.690
So if I hold down option I can copy this three times here and now that I have these inside my file I

03:42.690 --> 03:47.940
can still double click on these and let's click on the layers panel so we can see how these look here.

03:47.940 --> 03:49.520
So I still see this background.

03:49.530 --> 03:55.810
I can see the text and I can change this text too quick on me.

03:58.330 --> 04:06.970
I can resize those and if I want to change the look of this I can click this go to master component

04:07.880 --> 04:11.080
and it will jump into this project where the master component is.

04:11.300 --> 04:18.810
And here I can double click inside of here to change this to green for example and I can go back into

04:18.810 --> 04:19.540
my project.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.690
And nothing's changed yet.

04:22.170 --> 04:28.380
But if I go back into this bootstrap styles you can see that it's shown here that I've changed the style

04:28.410 --> 04:30.230
but I haven't published the change.

04:30.420 --> 04:36.690
So as soon as I click publish or of any team members click publish then it's going to tell me this is

04:36.690 --> 04:42.420
going to be updated in the library from blue to green so I could publish change here and we'll click

04:42.420 --> 04:45.590
on untitled and everything is still blue.

04:46.020 --> 04:51.600
But you notice here on the bottom right we have an alert that says component updates available so I

04:51.600 --> 04:56.250
can click dismiss her review here and I'll click dismiss right now.

04:57.630 --> 05:03.870
And one thing that's really nice is you're not surprised by some quick changes by team members and you

05:03.870 --> 05:06.930
don't have to adopt those changes that they created.

05:07.320 --> 05:13.920
But if we ever wanted to adopt those changes later we can click on this team library panel here and

05:13.920 --> 05:17.770
let's kick this back button and we can see that there's one update available.

05:17.970 --> 05:23.880
So click on that update and it will tell me this button primary and bootstrap change to green here.

05:24.270 --> 05:29.000
So I'll decide I want to update this to just click update and now everything's changed to green.

05:29.100 --> 05:36.300
It still has that blue stroke so I'll go back in here and I'll double click on this again change this

05:36.300 --> 05:43.160
blue stroke to maybe the same maybe a light green stroke or a dark green stroke.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.250
Let's just do that.

05:45.590 --> 05:52.280
Same thing here publish the change not published we can go back into our other project and we can click

05:52.280 --> 05:56.250
review immediately this time and update all changes.

05:56.330 --> 06:03.020
So the power behind Team libraries is you can have one team member that is designing all of the styles

06:03.020 --> 06:09.200
for a certain project or for multiple projects and at the same time you can have somebody else working

06:09.290 --> 06:15.440
on the project itself adopting those styles dragging them in and applying those.

06:15.440 --> 06:20.050
And then they can decide whether to adopt changes later as the style grows.

06:20.060 --> 06:26.330
So it's a great way to reuse styles and elements not just in your project like Master component's allows

06:26.360 --> 06:29.620
but throughout multiple projects and throughout the entire team.
