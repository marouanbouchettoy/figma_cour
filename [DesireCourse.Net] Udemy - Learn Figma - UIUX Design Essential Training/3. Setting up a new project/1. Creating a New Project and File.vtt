When you sign into figment getting started creating a new file is as easy as clicking one of these three

00:05.160 --> 00:09.910
buttons here but you may have multiple files that you want to be grouped into one project.

00:10.050 --> 00:16.110
So to get started creating a new project you first have to click on this new team icon here and create

00:16.110 --> 00:17.930
a team for your project.

00:17.940 --> 00:21.930
Now in this course we're going to be creating a chef recipes app.

00:21.930 --> 00:29.150
So I'm going to go ahead and name this team the chef team and if you don't want to start out paying

00:29.150 --> 00:36.400
the $12 a month you can just start with this free starter program so I'll get started for free here.

00:37.170 --> 00:43.990
And you can see here we have the chef team and now I can start my first project I'm going to call this

00:43.990 --> 00:47.670
the chef recipe project.

00:50.220 --> 00:55.620
And when you start this new project you can decide whether everybody on the team can edit view or if

00:55.620 --> 00:58.680
you want to just choose who has access in the future.

00:58.860 --> 01:06.300
So I'm going to allow everybody on the chef team to edit and now create this project here and now this

01:06.300 --> 01:07.430
project is started.

01:07.440 --> 01:14.560
We could create new files one for the iPhone app one for the Web site and one for marketing material.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.840
So that's how projects work.

01:17.190 --> 01:23.730
The first file that we're going to create in our project is the chef recipes app so we can name this

01:23.730 --> 01:26.130
file by clicking on the text here.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.880
We'll just name this Sheth underscore recipe app.

01:31.020 --> 01:36.000
And now if we go back to the start page we can see that we have that file here inside of our projects

01:36.450 --> 01:37.850
that is inside of the chef team.
