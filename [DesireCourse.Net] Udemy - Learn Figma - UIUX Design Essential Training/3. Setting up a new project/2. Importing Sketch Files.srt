00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,850
In the last video we created a brand new project and a new file the chef underscore recipe underscore

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,690
app.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,150
But what if you've started your project already inside of a program like sketch or what if you want

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,330
to start with a template and build your designs out from there.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,360
He does really good with importing sketch files and maintains the quality in the layering scheme that

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,570
you would expect to give you an example of this.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,950
I'm going to go into our exercise files under the assets folder and you can see we have a recipe app

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,680
template sketch file here that we can import.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,910
Now you can drag and drop in a sketch file directly into this project or you can browse the way that

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,520
I did and click open.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,980
And while this is loading this happens to be a template that I found on a Web site called Sketch app

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,210
sources now Sketchup sources have tons of templates whether it's the IRS template guidelines material

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,110
design you can see some Tesla dashboards here so feel free to go onto this Web site and browse these

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,430
thousands of templates and if there's something that you like with a certain flavor that matches where

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,590
you'd like to start you can click download resource here and then import it later here into Sigma.

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,690
Now this is important.

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,940
We'll click dumb.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,410
And now you can see this template here.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,270
And if we double click inside of here we can see how this looks.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,320
Now one of the first things that we can see is we may not have the fonts that were used in this template

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,000
so you can go online and find these or use type kits to find certain fonts and load them before you

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,410
get started with your design.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,130
Or you can just dismiss this and update your fonts later.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,460
We can see that this sketch template had two pages if we click on here we can see a symbol's page and

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,300
then a page one.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,340
So this is where they retained all of their symbols inside sketch and these symbols are converted into

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,870
Master components which is really great to go back to PAGE ONE here and we can see these different frames

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,910
and we see that the background is gray.

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,390
So we have a hard time distinguishing the boundaries between some of these frames.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,410
So all we have to do is go to this background area and change this to be like gray and we can kind of

31
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,570
see the contrast there between the frames and the background here.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,990
And another thing that you notice is although it retains a lot of the layering schemes and some of this

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,520
font here there are times where some layers may not import correctly.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,590
So if we go to this log in and sign up for example there are some missing text here between the log

35
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,780
in and sign up by him and things like that.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,690
So it may be worth your while to open up the sketch program and find the few layers that may be missing

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,450
and add those in manually.

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,790
But you can see how much time this will save you getting started with Fig.

39
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,460
If you're starting with a sketch file.
