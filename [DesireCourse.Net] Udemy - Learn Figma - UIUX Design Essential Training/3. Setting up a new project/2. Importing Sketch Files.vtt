In the last video we created a brand new project and a new file the chef underscore recipe underscore

00:05.910 --> 00:06.690
app.

00:06.930 --> 00:12.150
But what if you've started your project already inside of a program like sketch or what if you want

00:12.150 --> 00:16.330
to start with a template and build your designs out from there.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.360
He does really good with importing sketch files and maintains the quality in the layering scheme that

00:21.360 --> 00:24.570
you would expect to give you an example of this.

00:24.570 --> 00:30.950
I'm going to go into our exercise files under the assets folder and you can see we have a recipe app

00:30.960 --> 00:33.680
template sketch file here that we can import.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.910
Now you can drag and drop in a sketch file directly into this project or you can browse the way that

00:38.910 --> 00:41.520
I did and click open.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.980
And while this is loading this happens to be a template that I found on a Web site called Sketch app

00:46.980 --> 00:54.210
sources now Sketchup sources have tons of templates whether it's the IRS template guidelines material

00:54.210 --> 01:01.110
design you can see some Tesla dashboards here so feel free to go onto this Web site and browse these

01:01.110 --> 01:05.430
thousands of templates and if there's something that you like with a certain flavor that matches where

01:05.430 --> 01:11.590
you'd like to start you can click download resource here and then import it later here into Sigma.

01:11.610 --> 01:12.690
Now this is important.

01:12.690 --> 01:13.940
We'll click dumb.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.410
And now you can see this template here.

01:16.590 --> 01:20.270
And if we double click inside of here we can see how this looks.

01:20.280 --> 01:26.320
Now one of the first things that we can see is we may not have the fonts that were used in this template

01:26.760 --> 01:33.000
so you can go online and find these or use type kits to find certain fonts and load them before you

01:33.000 --> 01:34.410
get started with your design.

01:34.620 --> 01:39.130
Or you can just dismiss this and update your fonts later.

01:39.210 --> 01:44.460
We can see that this sketch template had two pages if we click on here we can see a symbol's page and

01:44.460 --> 01:45.300
then a page one.

01:45.300 --> 01:50.340
So this is where they retained all of their symbols inside sketch and these symbols are converted into

01:50.340 --> 01:56.870
Master components which is really great to go back to PAGE ONE here and we can see these different frames

01:57.420 --> 01:59.910
and we see that the background is gray.

01:59.910 --> 02:04.390
So we have a hard time distinguishing the boundaries between some of these frames.

02:04.440 --> 02:10.410
So all we have to do is go to this background area and change this to be like gray and we can kind of

02:10.410 --> 02:13.570
see the contrast there between the frames and the background here.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.990
And another thing that you notice is although it retains a lot of the layering schemes and some of this

02:19.990 --> 02:24.520
font here there are times where some layers may not import correctly.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.590
So if we go to this log in and sign up for example there are some missing text here between the log

02:29.590 --> 02:31.780
in and sign up by him and things like that.

02:31.780 --> 02:37.690
So it may be worth your while to open up the sketch program and find the few layers that may be missing

02:37.690 --> 02:39.450
and add those in manually.

02:39.670 --> 02:42.790
But you can see how much time this will save you getting started with Fig.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.460
If you're starting with a sketch file.
