00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,630
In a previous video we set up a team and that's this chef team and this is where we set up a project

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,530
here for our chef recipe app.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,470
If you skipped this video you can click here to set up a new team and name this team whatever you want.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,920
I'm going to hit cancel here because I already have one created.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,490
But if you haven't go ahead and create this team and once you do you'll get this little view here for

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,780
your team and you can see inside of this chef's team.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,280
I have a one project here but I don't have any team members working with me to really harness the power

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,200
of Sigma.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,950
I want to invite a new team member here so I'm going to click on this in a team member and I'm just

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,480
going to type in somebody's email

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,380
you can type in multiple people's email and this text field and then you can choose what access they

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,800
have to the projects inside of this team.

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,320
So whether they're an admin of the team or they can edit any projects within this team or only view.

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,960
So here I'm going to give them admin access and I'll just click and buy here their name and their avatar

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,170
is going to be grayed out until they accept my invite.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,640
And once they do they'll see the same team here when they log in to Sigma they'll see all the projects

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
that you're seeing and they can click at any time and edit regardless of if someone already has this

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,370
project open.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,600
If you have any questions or would like help throughout this course feel free to add me as a team member

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,730
inside of your project as well.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,830
You can add me at Caleb ADD brain spin dot com.

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,130
And once I accept your invite you will be able to use the comment feature to ask me specific questions

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,950
and I can jump in and help you resolve them.

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,150
After she has accepted the invite you can see the name and Avatar here.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,300
So now if I click on my chef recipe project here we can see that we have these two files here.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,810
And we've invited one member to our team and now we can see Marleen is in this file here.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,090
So if I want to collaborate with here I can double click and you'll see her mouse here and her avatar

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,820
here saying that she's actually interacting with the design.

29
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,460
So now we're going to ask her to drag this home our board around.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,370
And you can see her dragging that live.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,700
And if you want to follow her mouse while she's doing that just click on her avatar here and it'll follow

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,600
her as she interacts with things.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,510
So maybe drag that back up to the top here.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,050
And you get a nice view here of what she's doing and this is really helpful if your background has a

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,980
100 art boards and you're not sure where she's interacting with a certain are bored.

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,810
Just click on this name here and it'll zoom the canvas right in to where she's working.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,600
So now I've asked Marleen to add some text into the sign in and sign up button so she's going to go

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,850
ahead and do that now.

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,300
And while she's filling in that content I can style this for her so let me zoom in here and I can see

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,000
that she already typed this sign in button so I can go in here and change this to be white.

41
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,470
Change the font size to be 16.

42
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,060
And if I want to start out with the size I can hold down Option Command C to copy the style Option Command

43
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,980
V to paste it over here and then I just want to change this color.

44
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,230
So I'm going to change this to the same orange right here and get started here.

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,660
So you can see how easy and how close I can be designing with her as she is creating content and I'm

46
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,900
stylize ing it.

47
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:23,290
And then I can go and hold down option and bring this text over here or sign in and here for sign

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,260
and this is also very helpful if you're on an online screen sharing session with a client or with a

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,850
collaborator to have them open up the enigma as you are and you guys both designing together as you're

50
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,510
discussing your project is very powerful and very helpful.
