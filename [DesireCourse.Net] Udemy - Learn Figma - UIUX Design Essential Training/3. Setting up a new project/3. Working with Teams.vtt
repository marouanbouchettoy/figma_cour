00:00.470 --> 00:06.630
In a previous video we set up a team and that's this chef team and this is where we set up a project

00:06.630 --> 00:09.530
here for our chef recipe app.

00:09.660 --> 00:15.470
If you skipped this video you can click here to set up a new team and name this team whatever you want.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.920
I'm going to hit cancel here because I already have one created.

00:17.940 --> 00:23.490
But if you haven't go ahead and create this team and once you do you'll get this little view here for

00:23.490 --> 00:26.780
your team and you can see inside of this chef's team.

00:26.820 --> 00:32.280
I have a one project here but I don't have any team members working with me to really harness the power

00:32.280 --> 00:33.200
of Sigma.

00:33.360 --> 00:38.950
I want to invite a new team member here so I'm going to click on this in a team member and I'm just

00:38.950 --> 00:40.480
going to type in somebody's email

00:44.760 --> 00:49.380
you can type in multiple people's email and this text field and then you can choose what access they

00:49.380 --> 00:51.800
have to the projects inside of this team.

00:51.870 --> 00:57.320
So whether they're an admin of the team or they can edit any projects within this team or only view.

00:57.810 --> 01:03.960
So here I'm going to give them admin access and I'll just click and buy here their name and their avatar

01:03.960 --> 01:07.170
is going to be grayed out until they accept my invite.

01:07.170 --> 01:11.640
And once they do they'll see the same team here when they log in to Sigma they'll see all the projects

01:11.640 --> 01:16.200
that you're seeing and they can click at any time and edit regardless of if someone already has this

01:16.200 --> 01:17.370
project open.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.600
If you have any questions or would like help throughout this course feel free to add me as a team member

01:21.600 --> 01:23.730
inside of your project as well.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.830
You can add me at Caleb ADD brain spin dot com.

01:27.150 --> 01:32.130
And once I accept your invite you will be able to use the comment feature to ask me specific questions

01:32.130 --> 01:34.950
and I can jump in and help you resolve them.

01:34.950 --> 01:38.150
After she has accepted the invite you can see the name and Avatar here.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.300
So now if I click on my chef recipe project here we can see that we have these two files here.

01:43.470 --> 01:48.810
And we've invited one member to our team and now we can see Marleen is in this file here.

01:48.990 --> 01:54.090
So if I want to collaborate with here I can double click and you'll see her mouse here and her avatar

01:54.090 --> 01:58.820
here saying that she's actually interacting with the design.

01:59.020 --> 02:02.460
So now we're going to ask her to drag this home our board around.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.370
And you can see her dragging that live.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.700
And if you want to follow her mouse while she's doing that just click on her avatar here and it'll follow

02:09.700 --> 02:11.600
her as she interacts with things.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.510
So maybe drag that back up to the top here.

02:15.860 --> 02:21.050
And you get a nice view here of what she's doing and this is really helpful if your background has a

02:21.060 --> 02:25.980
100 art boards and you're not sure where she's interacting with a certain are bored.

02:26.090 --> 02:30.810
Just click on this name here and it'll zoom the canvas right in to where she's working.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.600
So now I've asked Marleen to add some text into the sign in and sign up button so she's going to go

02:35.600 --> 02:36.850
ahead and do that now.

02:37.700 --> 02:44.300
And while she's filling in that content I can style this for her so let me zoom in here and I can see

02:44.300 --> 02:50.000
that she already typed this sign in button so I can go in here and change this to be white.

02:50.060 --> 02:52.470
Change the font size to be 16.

02:52.790 --> 02:59.060
And if I want to start out with the size I can hold down Option Command C to copy the style Option Command

02:59.060 --> 03:02.980
V to paste it over here and then I just want to change this color.

03:03.230 --> 03:09.230
So I'm going to change this to the same orange right here and get started here.

03:09.500 --> 03:14.660
So you can see how easy and how close I can be designing with her as she is creating content and I'm

03:14.660 --> 03:15.900
stylize ing it.

03:16.220 --> 03:23.290
And then I can go and hold down option and bring this text over here or sign in and here for sign

03:27.250 --> 03:32.260
and this is also very helpful if you're on an online screen sharing session with a client or with a

03:32.260 --> 03:37.850
collaborator to have them open up the enigma as you are and you guys both designing together as you're

03:37.870 --> 03:41.510
discussing your project is very powerful and very helpful.
