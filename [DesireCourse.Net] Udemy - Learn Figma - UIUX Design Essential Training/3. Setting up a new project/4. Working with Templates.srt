00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,810
Inside the assets folder under exercise files you'll find this design templates text file.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,770
Now this text file just has a link to these four resources here.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,180
You find design templates and these templates come in very handy.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,060
For example if you're designing for iOS 11 you can go to developer Apple dot com and they have design

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,750
resources in this link here for scatch for Adobe XTi for other design files.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,300
And remember if it is a sketch file you can import that directly into Sigma and start from there.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,130
Alternatively if you're designing for Android you can get the material design template here and material

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,090
Dyo.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,810
And these two links below are community resources for sketch files and for Sigma files.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,280
So take a minute to visit these links and familiarize yourself with a few templates because it could

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,510
really help save some time.

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,700
For example if you download the iOS 11 design template from developer to Apple dot com you get this

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,710
folder and not only does it give you the sketch files here the production templates but it also gives

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,130
you the fonts used inside of this template so you don't find missing fonts once you load this up into

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,960
a figure so you can click inside here you can see that we have all of the San Francisco pro font packages

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,900
that come with the iPhone design.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,200
Then we have production templates here that are for app icons or for navigation Flo's and the last folder

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,970
here we have UI elements designs and guidelines.

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,060
And you can hit the spacebar on a Mac and kind of see a preview of the elements that you're going to

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,350
get once you import this template into figure.

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,150
I would highly encourage you to save these links in your bookmarks folder because as you're continuing

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,160
to design these are going to come in very handy.
