Inside the assets folder under exercise files you'll find this design templates text file.

00:06.810 --> 00:10.770
Now this text file just has a link to these four resources here.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.180
You find design templates and these templates come in very handy.

00:15.180 --> 00:21.060
For example if you're designing for iOS 11 you can go to developer Apple dot com and they have design

00:21.060 --> 00:27.750
resources in this link here for scatch for Adobe XTi for other design files.

00:27.750 --> 00:33.300
And remember if it is a sketch file you can import that directly into Sigma and start from there.

00:33.300 --> 00:38.130
Alternatively if you're designing for Android you can get the material design template here and material

00:38.130 --> 00:39.090
Dyo.

00:39.300 --> 00:45.810
And these two links below are community resources for sketch files and for Sigma files.

00:45.870 --> 00:50.280
So take a minute to visit these links and familiarize yourself with a few templates because it could

00:50.280 --> 00:52.510
really help save some time.

00:53.390 --> 00:58.700
For example if you download the iOS 11 design template from developer to Apple dot com you get this

00:58.700 --> 01:03.710
folder and not only does it give you the sketch files here the production templates but it also gives

01:03.710 --> 01:08.130
you the fonts used inside of this template so you don't find missing fonts once you load this up into

01:08.130 --> 01:14.960
a figure so you can click inside here you can see that we have all of the San Francisco pro font packages

01:14.960 --> 01:16.900
that come with the iPhone design.

01:17.060 --> 01:24.200
Then we have production templates here that are for app icons or for navigation Flo's and the last folder

01:24.200 --> 01:26.970
here we have UI elements designs and guidelines.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.060
And you can hit the spacebar on a Mac and kind of see a preview of the elements that you're going to

01:32.060 --> 01:35.350
get once you import this template into figure.

01:35.450 --> 01:41.150
I would highly encourage you to save these links in your bookmarks folder because as you're continuing

01:41.150 --> 01:44.160
to design these are going to come in very handy.
