1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,590
OK by now you've learned the interface and you've learned how to set up a project.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,210
And now you should have the skills that you need to begin working with content begin developing an app

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,790
as you can see in this image here.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,890
I've already sketched the kind of design that we're going to be creating inside a figure I sketched

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,300
this on my iPad and this is available in your assets folder as well as a PMG.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,060
And now it's time to get our hands dirty adding some content.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,850
So the first thing I'm going to do is go into Sigma here and in a previous video we already set up a

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,020
chef underscore a recipe on our sport app file.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,050
But if you haven't done this yet you can just click on new file here and just started from scratch with

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,870
us.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,020
If you do create a new file I'm just going to open up this file that we have your file name should say

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,120
untitled right here so to change that just click inside of this text area and you can name this whatever

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,890
you'd like.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,930
So now we have this new fresh file here.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,750
Any time that you'd like to you can go into the assets folder and find this PMG image and just open

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,410
it up for reference as we begin designing.

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,010
So the first thing we're going to do is set up five frames because we know those are the airports we're

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,740
going to start out with.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,050
So you create new frames we can click on this frame tool here and rather than dragging a custom shape

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,010
like we're doing here is going to hit delete and we can go into here in the pre-sets and I know I'm

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,260
going to be designing for the iPhone 8.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,870
So I'm just going to click on this preset here for an iPhone 8 frame.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,360
Now if I hold down command and scroll down you can zoom out here.

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:46,380
And I'm just going to hold down option is I drag this for other times.

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,520
OK so now we have five our boards and one thing that you can do to make your frames even is hold down

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,670
shift and select all of them and then you can use this to distribute a horizontal spacing here.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,330
So now we have some even spacing it looks really nice.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,380
The next thing you want to do is name our frames so we can click on the name here.

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,670
And if the frame is blank you can always click inside of the frame to drag it around.

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,610
But once you add some content in here like a rectangle for example.

31
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,720
Now if I click inside of this area I can't drag it anymore.

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,020
I have to click on the name here to drag it around.

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,250
So I'll delete this.

34
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,000
Now let's just name our frames.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,500
The first one is going to be the splash screen.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,680
Second one is home.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,270
Third is recipe

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,980
and I'll just name this recipe details.

39
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,970
And this will be recipe details complete

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,770
the last one here will name menu.

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,890
So we have our five our boards and you can drag these around very easily to reorder or reorganize them

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,250
as you're going along.

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,650
And now I can actually dragon select all of these.

44
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,590
Click on this distribute tool again and we're good to go.

45
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,260
Now a few shortcuts that you'll want to know is the number one on the keyboard.

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,800
We'll zoom everything into place and the numbers zero on the keyboard will zoom in to 100 percent.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,490
So they're really nice toggles to jump back and forth in some zoom commands.

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,510
Now that we have these frames set up we want to enable a layout grid so to do that we can click and

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,810
then hold down shift and click the following objects here.

50
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,170
We can also click inside of the layers panel hold down shift and click the bottom layer to select all

51
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,120
of them and you can see here in the design panel we have a layout grid section that we can just click

52
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,300
this plus icon and instead of a grid here we can change the grid size to 15 pixels.

53
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,740
We can change the opacity of the look or we can jump into columns here and I'm going to change the column

54
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:18,290
count to 6 and I know I want the gutter to be 10 pixels in between the columns.

55
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,390
I also want a 10 pixel margin here and between the columns as well and I tend to find this red color

56
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,090
a little bit more pronounced than I'd like.

57
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,060
So I'm going to change the transparency here to 5 percent just to hide that a little bit more.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,380
And now that I see this layout I'm thinking I probably want the edges of the frame here to have a 20

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,330
pixel margin for content so it's not writing right on the edge of that screen.

60
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,640
So we still have the 10 pixels here and between each column and this margin gives us 20 pixels on the

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,890
sides.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,480
If you only select one of these and you edit the layout grid here there's no way to really copy that

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,740
style from this frame to this other one.

64
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,050
So it's very important as you are setting these up to set them all up in the frame are going to apply

65
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,530
to.

66
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Now all of these frames are set to 375 pixels by 667 pixels and that's the device screen size for the

67
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,950
iPhone 8.

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,900
But there are times where your design is going to go beyond the device screen where you'll scroll up

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,220
and down so to resize these after they're created for example the home screen you can click and drag

70
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,550
this down and resize this.

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,360
So I like to start everything at the device screen high and then as I'm developing these shapes and

72
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,150
the styles if it starts to go past the screen you can quickly click and just drag down to increase your

73
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,460
frame size.

74
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,870
Also if you want to see more contrast between your frames in the background.

75
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,920
For example if your frame start out as gray You may not see a contrast here between the gray background

76
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,460
and the gray frame so you can always click on this background settings here and you can change this

77
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,690
down or you can change it to really whatever color you want.

78
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,580
But I like to have it just this like gray color here.
