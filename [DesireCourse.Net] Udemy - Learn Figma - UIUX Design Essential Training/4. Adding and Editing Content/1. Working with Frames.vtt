00:00.900 --> 00:05.590
OK by now you've learned the interface and you've learned how to set up a project.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.210
And now you should have the skills that you need to begin working with content begin developing an app

00:13.440 --> 00:14.790
as you can see in this image here.

00:14.790 --> 00:19.890
I've already sketched the kind of design that we're going to be creating inside a figure I sketched

00:19.890 --> 00:25.300
this on my iPad and this is available in your assets folder as well as a PMG.

00:25.710 --> 00:29.060
And now it's time to get our hands dirty adding some content.

00:29.460 --> 00:35.850
So the first thing I'm going to do is go into Sigma here and in a previous video we already set up a

00:35.850 --> 00:39.020
chef underscore a recipe on our sport app file.

00:39.030 --> 00:43.050
But if you haven't done this yet you can just click on new file here and just started from scratch with

00:43.050 --> 00:43.870
us.

00:43.950 --> 00:49.020
If you do create a new file I'm just going to open up this file that we have your file name should say

00:49.020 --> 00:54.120
untitled right here so to change that just click inside of this text area and you can name this whatever

00:54.120 --> 00:54.890
you'd like.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.930
So now we have this new fresh file here.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.750
Any time that you'd like to you can go into the assets folder and find this PMG image and just open

01:03.750 --> 01:06.410
it up for reference as we begin designing.

01:06.810 --> 01:11.010
So the first thing we're going to do is set up five frames because we know those are the airports we're

01:11.010 --> 01:12.740
going to start out with.

01:12.740 --> 01:19.050
So you create new frames we can click on this frame tool here and rather than dragging a custom shape

01:19.560 --> 01:26.010
like we're doing here is going to hit delete and we can go into here in the pre-sets and I know I'm

01:26.010 --> 01:28.260
going to be designing for the iPhone 8.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.870
So I'm just going to click on this preset here for an iPhone 8 frame.

01:33.870 --> 01:37.360
Now if I hold down command and scroll down you can zoom out here.

01:37.830 --> 01:46.380
And I'm just going to hold down option is I drag this for other times.

01:46.380 --> 01:53.520
OK so now we have five our boards and one thing that you can do to make your frames even is hold down

01:53.520 --> 01:58.670
shift and select all of them and then you can use this to distribute a horizontal spacing here.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.330
So now we have some even spacing it looks really nice.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.380
The next thing you want to do is name our frames so we can click on the name here.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.670
And if the frame is blank you can always click inside of the frame to drag it around.

02:09.690 --> 02:14.610
But once you add some content in here like a rectangle for example.

02:14.610 --> 02:17.720
Now if I click inside of this area I can't drag it anymore.

02:17.850 --> 02:21.020
I have to click on the name here to drag it around.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.250
So I'll delete this.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.000
Now let's just name our frames.

02:25.200 --> 02:31.500
The first one is going to be the splash screen.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.680
Second one is home.

02:35.690 --> 02:38.270
Third is recipe

02:41.760 --> 02:44.980
and I'll just name this recipe details.

02:48.010 --> 02:52.970
And this will be recipe details complete

02:58.480 --> 03:02.770
the last one here will name menu.

03:02.990 --> 03:09.890
So we have our five our boards and you can drag these around very easily to reorder or reorganize them

03:09.920 --> 03:12.250
as you're going along.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.650
And now I can actually dragon select all of these.

03:15.710 --> 03:20.590
Click on this distribute tool again and we're good to go.

03:20.690 --> 03:25.260
Now a few shortcuts that you'll want to know is the number one on the keyboard.

03:25.460 --> 03:30.800
We'll zoom everything into place and the numbers zero on the keyboard will zoom in to 100 percent.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.490
So they're really nice toggles to jump back and forth in some zoom commands.

03:37.260 --> 03:42.510
Now that we have these frames set up we want to enable a layout grid so to do that we can click and

03:42.510 --> 03:46.810
then hold down shift and click the following objects here.

03:46.830 --> 03:52.170
We can also click inside of the layers panel hold down shift and click the bottom layer to select all

03:52.170 --> 03:57.120
of them and you can see here in the design panel we have a layout grid section that we can just click

03:57.120 --> 04:04.300
this plus icon and instead of a grid here we can change the grid size to 15 pixels.

04:04.440 --> 04:10.740
We can change the opacity of the look or we can jump into columns here and I'm going to change the column

04:10.740 --> 04:18.290
count to 6 and I know I want the gutter to be 10 pixels in between the columns.

04:18.330 --> 04:24.390
I also want a 10 pixel margin here and between the columns as well and I tend to find this red color

04:24.390 --> 04:27.090
a little bit more pronounced than I'd like.

04:27.090 --> 04:32.060
So I'm going to change the transparency here to 5 percent just to hide that a little bit more.

04:32.160 --> 04:37.380
And now that I see this layout I'm thinking I probably want the edges of the frame here to have a 20

04:37.380 --> 04:42.330
pixel margin for content so it's not writing right on the edge of that screen.

04:42.330 --> 04:47.640
So we still have the 10 pixels here and between each column and this margin gives us 20 pixels on the

04:47.640 --> 04:48.890
sides.

04:48.960 --> 04:54.480
If you only select one of these and you edit the layout grid here there's no way to really copy that

04:54.480 --> 04:57.740
style from this frame to this other one.

04:57.750 --> 05:04.050
So it's very important as you are setting these up to set them all up in the frame are going to apply

05:04.050 --> 05:05.530
to.

05:05.580 --> 05:13.140
Now all of these frames are set to 375 pixels by 667 pixels and that's the device screen size for the

05:13.140 --> 05:13.950
iPhone 8.

05:14.100 --> 05:18.900
But there are times where your design is going to go beyond the device screen where you'll scroll up

05:18.900 --> 05:26.220
and down so to resize these after they're created for example the home screen you can click and drag

05:26.220 --> 05:28.550
this down and resize this.

05:28.620 --> 05:33.360
So I like to start everything at the device screen high and then as I'm developing these shapes and

05:33.360 --> 05:39.150
the styles if it starts to go past the screen you can quickly click and just drag down to increase your

05:39.150 --> 05:40.460
frame size.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.870
Also if you want to see more contrast between your frames in the background.

05:44.010 --> 05:49.920
For example if your frame start out as gray You may not see a contrast here between the gray background

05:49.920 --> 05:56.460
and the gray frame so you can always click on this background settings here and you can change this

05:56.520 --> 05:59.690
down or you can change it to really whatever color you want.

05:59.940 --> 06:03.580
But I like to have it just this like gray color here.
