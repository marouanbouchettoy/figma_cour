1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,640
The components features one of my favorite features inside a figure and you'll quickly understand why

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,650
as we move along this video.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,020
So until now we've been creating a bunch of icons that are basic shapes inside a figure and one drawback

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,760
from that is if I hold down option and copy this over here and I decide to change the style of this

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,690
for example if I zoom in here and move this to be a little bit wider here it doesn't change anywhere

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,060
else.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,830
So I have to go in and copy and paste this across to different frames.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,350
Now if I want I can choose a lot of these icons here.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm going to name this too.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,270
But an menu and I'll name this too.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,920
But Insearch and now I can click on any of these elements and click on this create component.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,670
And now if I go to my components panel you can see I have these two components here and I can reuse

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,400
these anywhere that I want.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,390
And that's really handy so I can drag and drop this on any frames that I want.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,920
And now if I click on this master component and I change anything that I want the color or anything

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,780
else it changes everywhere that I have those copied.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,110
I'm going to undo this and or remove those and I'll show you a more powerful way of using components.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,790
For example we have this five star rating system.

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,740
So what if we had a component that we can reuse and we can change this Five-Star has to be one and a

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,190
half stars two and a half stars or whatever.

21
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,000
So first thing I'm going to do is click and ungroup all of these.

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,000
And what I want is I want an unfilled star so I'm going to choose this star here and then I want a field

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,860
star so I'll choose this star and I'll overlay this and I want to move this up inside of my layers panel.

24
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,700
I want to move this just up above the other one.

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:05,850
So now we have a light gray star and then a red star and I'm going to just call this star hyphen unfilled

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:16,220
and then I'll call this one star HIF and field.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,720
Now all aligned these are the last one that we have here.

28
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm going to make sure this is clear up of the top here in the laser system.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,680
So if I scroll up here let's bring this to the top of the home page and I'm going to align this and

30
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,520
remember this doesn't align too well.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,670
Now it's on subpixel so I can still double click inside of here and just select these two shapes underneath

32
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,010
this and all align that to snap.

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,430
And then I will call this star hyphen half hyphen field.

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,050
So we have the three versions of the star that we're always going to need fully filled and filled and

35
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,250
a half filled so I can select these objects here.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,490
And let's just move this up to make sure that their layers are close to each other.

37
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,240
And now that I've done this I have my naming scheme good.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,220
In fact I have some capital letters.

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,750
I'm just going to change this to be all lowercase.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,610
Just for uniformity it really doesn't matter.

41
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,820
But I'm going to click on these three layers now and I'll click Create component and I can call this

42
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,510
master component star.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,390
So now if I copy this five times I'm going hold down option and copy this five different times.

44
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:55,850
These child components have layer overrides so I can click on any of these stars here and I can choose

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,870
to hide the Handfield icon and also the field icon right here.

46
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,280
So now we have this unfilled icon I can do the same thing here.

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,820
Hide these two layers.

48
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,410
Let's say this is two and a half stars.

49
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,370
So here I want to keep this half star field visible but I want to remove this Starfield underneath it

50
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,230
and we have two and a half stars.

51
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,650
Now I can delete these guys here.

52
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:25,370
These are just simple shapes and I have these five child components and now I can center these here

53
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,520
in the center of this art board and actually create a nother component here.

54
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,070
And the reason why I didn't include this master component inside of here is because you can't nest master

55
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,480
components inside of other components you have to use child components.

56
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,750
So you create one master component and then let's copy all of these and click Create component again

57
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,580
and I'm going to call this five stars.

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,860
So this is a new master component.

59
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,890
I'm going to zoom out and we can just place this master component outside of the frame here because

60
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,760
we don't want to show it inside of our design.

61
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,650
Now I can delete this five star system over here and copy this master component hold down option and

62
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,610
I'll copy this over here.

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
And now the really nice thing is this is the child component.

64
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,700
But I can still drill down inside of here and choose this star here in the middle.

65
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:31,250
I'm going to make this field and I can make this one here half field so we can change it very quickly.

66
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,340
But now if we go in here and decide to give this a little bit more spacing I can still click on each

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,490
of these objects and I can just nudge this around and you can see over to the right.

68
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,360
This is also being updated.

69
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,070
So I'm changing this one master component here and the spacing is applied over here.

70
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,290
If I ever want to change the color of this star here of the half star and the full star here I can just

71
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:13,020
select both of these components so I'll choose star half field and Starfield and all the side.

72
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,890
Maybe I want these to be yellow.

73
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:23,050
So as soon as I change that to be yellow or gold I can now zoom out and everything is changed here so

74
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,480
very easily and very quickly we created components within components and we can do the same thing with

75
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,770
these guys here.

76
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:38,950
So if I click and ungroup these shift command G and group or you can right click inside of different

77
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,470
areas here and just choose ungroup.

78
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,970
Now I want to create one component with all of these objects.

79
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:54,820
So all I have to do is bring these down here and just align them to the center of each other and I'm

80
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:04,480
going to name these after I ungroup them all the way I can comment and I'll move these out of the way

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,180
so I can see which one I'm remaining.

82
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,860
So this is the icon

83
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
timer and this is the icon heart

84
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,510
now we can grab all three of these and a line in the middle and the center.

85
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,950
And because we have all of these now we can choose to create component.

86
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,180
And let's just call these icons.

87
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,330
Now if we hold down option we can move this and if we clicked this arrow in the layers panel now we

88
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,370
can decide that we want to only show the timer here.

89
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,720
Hold down option and drag over here.

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,120
And here we want to show the heart.

91
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,720
Let's drag one more time.

92
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,620
And here we want to show the comment.

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,240
So now at any time with this master component you can resize this you can move this around here in the

94
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,100
components area and you can change the styling.

95
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,300
Replace them and it's a great way to organize your icons this way so that you can toggle on and off

96
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,630
within this layers panel.

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,150
Now we can see that we have this master component icons and we also have this master component which

98
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,480
is the star.

99
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,180
And we don't really want this inside of our frames because we're only using the child components here

100
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,710
so we can click on this page view and click new page.

101
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,190
And this is where I like to create a page called symbols.

102
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,780
And if I click back to PAGE ONE I can click and drag here and just right click and move this to symbols

103
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,260
here.

104
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,250
Now if I ever want to see where the master component is to edit this I can right click inside of here

105
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,850
and click go to master component and then jumps right to the symbol page and tells me here's where it

106
00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:00,350
is and now if I click on this and I add a stroke for example and I know that looks really ugly but just

107
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,990
for demo purposes let's go back to the page one that we can see that that changed here as well.

108
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,710
So get it right quick go back to master component and hold down command.

109
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,790
I can go into this group and remove this stroke here.

110
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,990
We'll go back into Page 1 and we can see that that's updated.

111
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,980
So I would recommend storing your master components inside of the symbols.

112
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,380
Or you can name this components to match where they really are.

113
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,390
I actually named them symbols because I'm used to sketch map where the components have a different name

114
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,400
and that is symbols.

115
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,300
So now this is renamed to components.

116
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,350
We have all of these icons here set up as components.

117
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,260
These are set up as components and we can do the same thing here.

118
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,850
This could be one component or they could be two.

119
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:55,040
So we can click on here quick create component and we can name this shopping create this component

120
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,980
and preparation.

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,790
Now the last component we want to create is this hot button.

122
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,690
So I'm going to call this button heart and we'll click Create component here.

123
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,520
Now there are times that this heart is going to be filled or unfilled.

124
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,900
So now we've created a component.

125
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,890
I'm going to zoom into here and this is the master component.

126
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100
But we can still click inside of here.

127
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,500
We can see that we have a button heart inside of this Master component.

128
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm just going to name this heart outline and if I use command C and command B to paste this I'm going

129
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,060
to name this one heart field

130
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,800
and the only thing I'm going to change here if I double click on this icon.

131
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,870
You can see I have these two shapes that I merged.

132
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,800
I actually want to bake this in so if I click on this harp field here I'm going to go to object and

133
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,920
flatten selection and that will bake everything has one shape.

134
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:15,950
And now I can click inside of here add a white fill and even remove the stroke here.

135
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,240
So we have one field heart and one outlined heart.

136
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,280
And anywhere we have this heart saved we can always toggle that on and off using these layers.

137
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,630
This is also a basic shape so we want to delete this.

138
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,760
We can click on this master component here and again hold down option and copy this over here and it

139
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,700
creates a child component.

140
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,810
And again now we can change the layering inside of here.

141
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,960
We can change this to be filled if we want this to be unfilled.

142
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,500
And because it's the same component if you ever change the color or style in the master section it'll

143
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,050
also change here.

144
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:03,080
Now let's scroll down here and we'll see this preparation window here if I just squeeze this down a

145
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
little bit to give some room over here.

146
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,350
I actually want to have each preparation area I want to have an icon here that represents the steps.

147
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,740
So I'm going to zoom in a little bit and I'll show you how to create some nice components for this.

148
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:25,130
So the first thing I'm going to do is click Oh for this ellipse and I'll just create a 20 pixel by pixel

149
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,370
circle here.

150
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:33,960
And I actually want this color to be the same colors that unfilled star so I can come back over here.

151
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,230
I can double click inside of here and if I choose the star unfilled.

152
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,490
All right click and copy style.

153
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,840
I'll come down here right quick and paste the style so that looks good.

154
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,140
I'm going to add some text inside of this so this text is just going to say one.

155
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,970
And we're using rubato here you can use whatever form that you want.

156
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:04,940
I'm going to make this bold here and I'll create this to be read text and if I zoom inside of here now

157
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,180
I'm going to do this to be centered

158
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:19,060
and I'll just change the width of this and the height of this to match.

159
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,970
And I'm going to sit this texture right in the center of this circle.

160
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:36,640
So we have a one and I can group this and call this step number and then I want to hold down option

161
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,850
and copy this and I say this step is completed.

162
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,860
Well now we want to double click in here until we select this circle here or this the lips and let's

163
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:54,590
fill this color to be red and I'm going to remove this text and now I want to create a checkmark icon.

164
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,450
So very easily I can use this pen tool.

165
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:05,530
And I'll just click and create a checkmark something like this will be good and I want the stroke to

166
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,710
be two pixels.

167
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,960
And now I want to cap the ends.

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,190
I want them to be rounded.

169
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm going to change the color here to be white.

170
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,840
Get a scrape a few times.

171
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,440
I accidentally created a new shape out here I'm going to delete.

172
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,630
OK so we have that check mark.

173
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,380
I'm going to just balance this center it here in a circle.

174
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,110
And sometimes because it's a little bit offset and you kind of have to eyeball it I'm going to hold

175
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,450
down shift and let's just align this horizontally.

176
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,310
So we have this step completed.

177
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,900
So now I'm going to drag this vector shape into this other step number group instead of naming this

178
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,790
step number.

179
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,400
We're going to do step complete case.

180
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,580
So now we have our step number and our step complete we can do the same thing where we align this here

181
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:07,390
to the top we're in select both of these and we're to create a component and we'll just call this icon

182
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,220
steps.

183
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,630
Now because this is a master component I'm going to hold down option and drag this down to create a

184
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,660
child component.

185
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,350
And then again I'm going to right click and move the master component to the page components and then

186
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,500
I can use all these child components möglich inside of here.

187
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,200
Remove step complete.

188
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,020
And now I just have the step number but one thing that's really nice is I can hold down option and copy

189
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,480
this a few times and I can still go inside here in this text and if I double click a few times I can

190
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:50,610
change the number here to 1 to 3 and watch this if we change this to step 22 we see that there's not

191
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,640
enough padding around here and we've already committed to our design here and it's going to take a lot

192
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,750
of work to go on here and change all the sizes here of the fonts to kind of help this padding to be

193
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,810
correct.

194
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,760
But because we created components we can still right click and jump to master component.

195
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,600
So we can see that the master component hasn't changed if we double click inside of here and we choose

196
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
this group.

197
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,330
We're going to move this away and you can still see where it says one.

198
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,900
So that text that we changed is just overridden in those trial components it's not going to change here

199
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,870
but just for this master component I'm going to hide this.

200
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:38,310
And now I can click on this font inside of the master component and I can choose to resize this to 12

201
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,200
and maybe Let's try 10 here.

202
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,360
So we resize this to 10.

203
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,460
I can jump back into my pages and you can see it fits a lot nicer.

204
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,340
Now we could have clicked inside of just this number inside of here if we wanted this text to be larger

205
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,590
than just this text would be smaller.

206
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,090
We can click inside of here and change this to even be 48 pixels for example.

207
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,440
That's way too large.

208
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm going to choose 14 pixels and you can see that this change and none of these changed.

209
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,270
That's because if you change anything in a child component that's actually going to override that change.

210
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,430
And when you change the master component now if you change the size it'll change the size of all of

211
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,100
these.

212
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,670
But it won't change this because you've overridden that size.

213
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:28,380
If you want to ever change this back you can double click inside of this text area and you can go back

214
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,730
into this little button here this instance button and you can choose to reset all overwrites.

215
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,110
So right now we overrode the name so we typed in 22 and that's different in the master component.

216
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:46,080
We overrode the text we overrode the textile so we can choose to not reset the text but we can reset

217
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,110
that style.

218
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,340
And that brings it back down and we could reset the name if we wanted.

219
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,300
But I'm just going to leave that and I can see that these are sitting a little bit high to the circles

220
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,590
on the right click and go to master component again.

221
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,120
And if I double click on this text.

222
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,840
Let's just have this sit down just a little bit something like this.

223
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,410
Let's jump back into our pages and see if that looks better.

224
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,860
I think that looks a little bit better here.

225
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,350
So now going down the list I'm going to just change this to four and let's say that these steps are

226
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,020
complete here.

227
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,690
So I'm just going to mark this is complete and the first few steps we'll just say are complete here.

228
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,930
Little Linus here with the top of this text

229
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,660
and let's say it's all but the last is complete and these are a little bit too many steps.

230
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,770
So I know if you try to follow this recipe you're probably going to screw up because I'm going to delete

231
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,720
a bunch of mid text inside of here.

232
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,020
But this is just for visual representation.

233
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,190
And I don't want the art board to be that long so I'm just changing this just deleting the little bit

234
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,560
of these steps.

235
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,990
So let's just have you know three or four steps here.

236
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:11,070
So three of them are completed and this fourth one is not.

237
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,450
Now I want to make sure things are lined up correctly so I'm going to hold down option b c there's 31

238
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,150
pixels here.

239
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,230
I actually want to nudge this so there's only 20 pixels here then I want 10 pixels to be in between

240
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,670
here and I just want to hold down shift and nudge at once.

241
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,440
And now we have 10 pixels and then I want this side to be 20 pixels so I'm going to hold down command

242
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,490
and nudge this one two three four five six.

243
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,820
OK.

244
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,330
So everything looks good.

245
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,430
And we have our steps.

246
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,330
Now zoom out here and take a look at this.

247
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,840
This is all looking really good now.

248
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,370
And to match the lining here this shows 14 by 14.

249
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,990
I'm just going to line this here with the edge here and then nudge this holding now command left arrow

250
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,800
left arrow and command shift left arrow once more.

251
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,630
So we have a 20 by 20 so we can see this is a line really good.

252
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,170
And go into a line.

253
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:17,180
The ease with the edges here.

254
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,310
So those are components we've now converted all of our icons to components here and they're ready to

255
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,490
be reused throughout all of the other designs.

256
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,880
For example I'm just going to hold down option here and I'll just move this over here because I know

257
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,230
we're going to use the same kind of five star scheme inside of this design in the future.

258
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,780
Again now if we click on this components panel you can see all of our components here.

259
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:49,210
We have six components on our home page and we have three components here under the components background.
