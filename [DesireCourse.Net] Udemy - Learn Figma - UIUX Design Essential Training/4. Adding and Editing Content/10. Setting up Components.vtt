00:01.260 --> 00:05.640
The components features one of my favorite features inside a figure and you'll quickly understand why

00:05.640 --> 00:07.650
as we move along this video.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.020
So until now we've been creating a bunch of icons that are basic shapes inside a figure and one drawback

00:15.060 --> 00:20.760
from that is if I hold down option and copy this over here and I decide to change the style of this

00:21.090 --> 00:27.690
for example if I zoom in here and move this to be a little bit wider here it doesn't change anywhere

00:27.690 --> 00:28.060
else.

00:28.080 --> 00:34.830
So I have to go in and copy and paste this across to different frames.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.350
Now if I want I can choose a lot of these icons here.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.240
I'm going to name this too.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.270
But an menu and I'll name this too.

00:45.280 --> 00:53.920
But Insearch and now I can click on any of these elements and click on this create component.

00:54.060 --> 00:59.670
And now if I go to my components panel you can see I have these two components here and I can reuse

00:59.670 --> 01:01.400
these anywhere that I want.

01:01.710 --> 01:06.390
And that's really handy so I can drag and drop this on any frames that I want.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.920
And now if I click on this master component and I change anything that I want the color or anything

01:10.920 --> 01:14.780
else it changes everywhere that I have those copied.

01:15.180 --> 01:23.110
I'm going to undo this and or remove those and I'll show you a more powerful way of using components.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.790
For example we have this five star rating system.

01:26.790 --> 01:31.740
So what if we had a component that we can reuse and we can change this Five-Star has to be one and a

01:31.740 --> 01:35.190
half stars two and a half stars or whatever.

01:35.190 --> 01:40.000
So first thing I'm going to do is click and ungroup all of these.

01:40.500 --> 01:48.000
And what I want is I want an unfilled star so I'm going to choose this star here and then I want a field

01:48.000 --> 01:54.860
star so I'll choose this star and I'll overlay this and I want to move this up inside of my layers panel.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.700
I want to move this just up above the other one.

01:57.790 --> 02:05.850
So now we have a light gray star and then a red star and I'm going to just call this star hyphen unfilled

02:07.260 --> 02:16.220
and then I'll call this one star HIF and field.

02:16.460 --> 02:20.720
Now all aligned these are the last one that we have here.

02:20.810 --> 02:25.700
I'm going to make sure this is clear up of the top here in the laser system.

02:25.700 --> 02:32.680
So if I scroll up here let's bring this to the top of the home page and I'm going to align this and

02:32.690 --> 02:34.520
remember this doesn't align too well.

02:34.520 --> 02:40.670
Now it's on subpixel so I can still double click inside of here and just select these two shapes underneath

02:40.790 --> 02:44.010
this and all align that to snap.

02:44.450 --> 02:51.430
And then I will call this star hyphen half hyphen field.

02:51.740 --> 02:57.050
So we have the three versions of the star that we're always going to need fully filled and filled and

02:57.050 --> 03:02.250
a half filled so I can select these objects here.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.490
And let's just move this up to make sure that their layers are close to each other.

03:11.820 --> 03:15.240
And now that I've done this I have my naming scheme good.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.220
In fact I have some capital letters.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.750
I'm just going to change this to be all lowercase.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.610
Just for uniformity it really doesn't matter.

03:23.850 --> 03:29.820
But I'm going to click on these three layers now and I'll click Create component and I can call this

03:29.820 --> 03:34.510
master component star.

03:34.650 --> 03:41.390
So now if I copy this five times I'm going hold down option and copy this five different times.

03:46.970 --> 03:55.850
These child components have layer overrides so I can click on any of these stars here and I can choose

03:56.120 --> 03:59.870
to hide the Handfield icon and also the field icon right here.

03:59.870 --> 04:04.280
So now we have this unfilled icon I can do the same thing here.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.820
Hide these two layers.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.410
Let's say this is two and a half stars.

04:07.410 --> 04:13.370
So here I want to keep this half star field visible but I want to remove this Starfield underneath it

04:13.790 --> 04:17.230
and we have two and a half stars.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.650
Now I can delete these guys here.

04:19.670 --> 04:25.370
These are just simple shapes and I have these five child components and now I can center these here

04:25.370 --> 04:31.520
in the center of this art board and actually create a nother component here.

04:31.550 --> 04:37.070
And the reason why I didn't include this master component inside of here is because you can't nest master

04:37.070 --> 04:41.480
components inside of other components you have to use child components.

04:41.480 --> 04:47.750
So you create one master component and then let's copy all of these and click Create component again

04:48.350 --> 04:52.580
and I'm going to call this five stars.

04:52.970 --> 04:54.860
So this is a new master component.

04:55.880 --> 05:00.890
I'm going to zoom out and we can just place this master component outside of the frame here because

05:00.890 --> 05:03.760
we don't want to show it inside of our design.

05:05.420 --> 05:12.650
Now I can delete this five star system over here and copy this master component hold down option and

05:12.650 --> 05:14.610
I'll copy this over here.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.480
And now the really nice thing is this is the child component.

05:17.480 --> 05:22.700
But I can still drill down inside of here and choose this star here in the middle.

05:22.820 --> 05:31.250
I'm going to make this field and I can make this one here half field so we can change it very quickly.

05:32.630 --> 05:37.340
But now if we go in here and decide to give this a little bit more spacing I can still click on each

05:37.340 --> 05:42.490
of these objects and I can just nudge this around and you can see over to the right.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.360
This is also being updated.

05:53.290 --> 05:58.070
So I'm changing this one master component here and the spacing is applied over here.

05:58.840 --> 06:05.290
If I ever want to change the color of this star here of the half star and the full star here I can just

06:05.290 --> 06:13.020
select both of these components so I'll choose star half field and Starfield and all the side.

06:13.210 --> 06:14.890
Maybe I want these to be yellow.

06:15.370 --> 06:23.050
So as soon as I change that to be yellow or gold I can now zoom out and everything is changed here so

06:23.110 --> 06:28.480
very easily and very quickly we created components within components and we can do the same thing with

06:28.810 --> 06:29.770
these guys here.

06:29.780 --> 06:38.950
So if I click and ungroup these shift command G and group or you can right click inside of different

06:38.950 --> 06:42.470
areas here and just choose ungroup.

06:42.490 --> 06:45.970
Now I want to create one component with all of these objects.

06:46.060 --> 06:54.820
So all I have to do is bring these down here and just align them to the center of each other and I'm

06:54.820 --> 07:04.480
going to name these after I ungroup them all the way I can comment and I'll move these out of the way

07:04.480 --> 07:07.180
so I can see which one I'm remaining.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.860
So this is the icon

07:11.680 --> 07:15.120
timer and this is the icon heart

07:19.550 --> 07:23.510
now we can grab all three of these and a line in the middle and the center.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.950
And because we have all of these now we can choose to create component.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.180
And let's just call these icons.

07:32.780 --> 07:38.330
Now if we hold down option we can move this and if we clicked this arrow in the layers panel now we

07:38.330 --> 07:42.370
can decide that we want to only show the timer here.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.720
Hold down option and drag over here.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.120
And here we want to show the heart.

07:48.940 --> 07:50.720
Let's drag one more time.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.620
And here we want to show the comment.

07:54.080 --> 07:59.240
So now at any time with this master component you can resize this you can move this around here in the

07:59.240 --> 08:03.100
components area and you can change the styling.

08:03.110 --> 08:10.300
Replace them and it's a great way to organize your icons this way so that you can toggle on and off

08:10.310 --> 08:12.630
within this layers panel.

08:12.650 --> 08:17.150
Now we can see that we have this master component icons and we also have this master component which

08:17.150 --> 08:18.480
is the star.

08:18.890 --> 08:24.180
And we don't really want this inside of our frames because we're only using the child components here

08:25.190 --> 08:28.710
so we can click on this page view and click new page.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.190
And this is where I like to create a page called symbols.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.780
And if I click back to PAGE ONE I can click and drag here and just right click and move this to symbols

08:38.780 --> 08:41.260
here.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.250
Now if I ever want to see where the master component is to edit this I can right click inside of here

08:47.330 --> 08:52.850
and click go to master component and then jumps right to the symbol page and tells me here's where it

08:52.850 --> 09:00.350
is and now if I click on this and I add a stroke for example and I know that looks really ugly but just

09:00.350 --> 09:05.990
for demo purposes let's go back to the page one that we can see that that changed here as well.

09:06.020 --> 09:11.710
So get it right quick go back to master component and hold down command.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.790
I can go into this group and remove this stroke here.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.990
We'll go back into Page 1 and we can see that that's updated.

09:20.990 --> 09:24.980
So I would recommend storing your master components inside of the symbols.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.380
Or you can name this components to match where they really are.

09:27.380 --> 09:32.390
I actually named them symbols because I'm used to sketch map where the components have a different name

09:32.390 --> 09:34.400
and that is symbols.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.300
So now this is renamed to components.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.350
We have all of these icons here set up as components.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.260
These are set up as components and we can do the same thing here.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.850
This could be one component or they could be two.

09:45.050 --> 09:55.040
So we can click on here quick create component and we can name this shopping create this component

09:57.920 --> 10:04.980
and preparation.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.790
Now the last component we want to create is this hot button.

10:09.050 --> 10:16.690
So I'm going to call this button heart and we'll click Create component here.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.520
Now there are times that this heart is going to be filled or unfilled.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.900
So now we've created a component.

10:22.130 --> 10:26.890
I'm going to zoom into here and this is the master component.

10:27.140 --> 10:29.100
But we can still click inside of here.

10:29.390 --> 10:33.500
We can see that we have a button heart inside of this Master component.

10:33.950 --> 10:42.350
I'm just going to name this heart outline and if I use command C and command B to paste this I'm going

10:42.350 --> 10:44.060
to name this one heart field

10:47.650 --> 10:52.800
and the only thing I'm going to change here if I double click on this icon.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.870
You can see I have these two shapes that I merged.

10:55.990 --> 11:02.800
I actually want to bake this in so if I click on this harp field here I'm going to go to object and

11:02.800 --> 11:06.920
flatten selection and that will bake everything has one shape.

11:07.510 --> 11:15.950
And now I can click inside of here add a white fill and even remove the stroke here.

11:17.270 --> 11:21.240
So we have one field heart and one outlined heart.

11:22.490 --> 11:29.280
And anywhere we have this heart saved we can always toggle that on and off using these layers.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.630
This is also a basic shape so we want to delete this.

11:32.750 --> 11:37.760
We can click on this master component here and again hold down option and copy this over here and it

11:37.760 --> 11:39.700
creates a child component.

11:40.130 --> 11:44.810
And again now we can change the layering inside of here.

11:44.810 --> 11:47.960
We can change this to be filled if we want this to be unfilled.

11:48.620 --> 11:54.500
And because it's the same component if you ever change the color or style in the master section it'll

11:54.500 --> 11:57.050
also change here.

11:57.050 --> 12:03.080
Now let's scroll down here and we'll see this preparation window here if I just squeeze this down a

12:03.080 --> 12:04.720
little bit to give some room over here.

12:04.880 --> 12:11.350
I actually want to have each preparation area I want to have an icon here that represents the steps.

12:11.530 --> 12:16.740
So I'm going to zoom in a little bit and I'll show you how to create some nice components for this.

12:17.030 --> 12:25.130
So the first thing I'm going to do is click Oh for this ellipse and I'll just create a 20 pixel by pixel

12:25.130 --> 12:26.370
circle here.

12:26.630 --> 12:33.960
And I actually want this color to be the same colors that unfilled star so I can come back over here.

12:34.220 --> 12:39.230
I can double click inside of here and if I choose the star unfilled.

12:39.710 --> 12:42.490
All right click and copy style.

12:42.650 --> 12:47.840
I'll come down here right quick and paste the style so that looks good.

12:48.170 --> 12:52.140
I'm going to add some text inside of this so this text is just going to say one.

12:53.180 --> 12:55.970
And we're using rubato here you can use whatever form that you want.

12:55.970 --> 13:04.940
I'm going to make this bold here and I'll create this to be read text and if I zoom inside of here now

13:07.590 --> 13:09.180
I'm going to do this to be centered

13:11.960 --> 13:19.060
and I'll just change the width of this and the height of this to match.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.970
And I'm going to sit this texture right in the center of this circle.

13:24.790 --> 13:36.640
So we have a one and I can group this and call this step number and then I want to hold down option

13:36.640 --> 13:39.850
and copy this and I say this step is completed.

13:39.940 --> 13:44.860
Well now we want to double click in here until we select this circle here or this the lips and let's

13:44.860 --> 13:54.590
fill this color to be red and I'm going to remove this text and now I want to create a checkmark icon.

13:55.270 --> 13:57.450
So very easily I can use this pen tool.

13:57.760 --> 14:05.530
And I'll just click and create a checkmark something like this will be good and I want the stroke to

14:05.530 --> 14:07.710
be two pixels.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.960
And now I want to cap the ends.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.190
I want them to be rounded.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.040
I'm going to change the color here to be white.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.840
Get a scrape a few times.

14:17.870 --> 14:22.440
I accidentally created a new shape out here I'm going to delete.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.630
OK so we have that check mark.

14:25.840 --> 14:30.380
I'm going to just balance this center it here in a circle.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.110
And sometimes because it's a little bit offset and you kind of have to eyeball it I'm going to hold

14:35.110 --> 14:40.450
down shift and let's just align this horizontally.

14:40.450 --> 14:43.310
So we have this step completed.

14:43.990 --> 14:49.900
So now I'm going to drag this vector shape into this other step number group instead of naming this

14:49.900 --> 14:50.790
step number.

14:50.860 --> 14:55.400
We're going to do step complete case.

14:55.410 --> 15:00.580
So now we have our step number and our step complete we can do the same thing where we align this here

15:00.580 --> 15:07.390
to the top we're in select both of these and we're to create a component and we'll just call this icon

15:07.450 --> 15:10.220
steps.

15:10.470 --> 15:15.630
Now because this is a master component I'm going to hold down option and drag this down to create a

15:15.630 --> 15:16.660
child component.

15:16.890 --> 15:22.350
And then again I'm going to right click and move the master component to the page components and then

15:22.350 --> 15:26.500
I can use all these child components möglich inside of here.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.200
Remove step complete.

15:28.500 --> 15:34.020
And now I just have the step number but one thing that's really nice is I can hold down option and copy

15:34.020 --> 15:39.480
this a few times and I can still go inside here in this text and if I double click a few times I can

15:39.480 --> 15:50.610
change the number here to 1 to 3 and watch this if we change this to step 22 we see that there's not

15:50.610 --> 15:56.640
enough padding around here and we've already committed to our design here and it's going to take a lot

15:56.640 --> 16:03.750
of work to go on here and change all the sizes here of the fonts to kind of help this padding to be

16:03.780 --> 16:04.810
correct.

16:05.370 --> 16:10.760
But because we created components we can still right click and jump to master component.

16:11.040 --> 16:15.600
So we can see that the master component hasn't changed if we double click inside of here and we choose

16:15.600 --> 16:16.560
this group.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.330
We're going to move this away and you can still see where it says one.

16:20.340 --> 16:25.900
So that text that we changed is just overridden in those trial components it's not going to change here

16:26.670 --> 16:29.870
but just for this master component I'm going to hide this.

16:30.870 --> 16:38.310
And now I can click on this font inside of the master component and I can choose to resize this to 12

16:40.290 --> 16:42.200
and maybe Let's try 10 here.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.360
So we resize this to 10.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.460
I can jump back into my pages and you can see it fits a lot nicer.

16:48.480 --> 16:53.340
Now we could have clicked inside of just this number inside of here if we wanted this text to be larger

16:53.550 --> 16:55.590
than just this text would be smaller.

16:55.590 --> 17:00.090
We can click inside of here and change this to even be 48 pixels for example.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.440
That's way too large.

17:01.440 --> 17:07.300
I'm going to choose 14 pixels and you can see that this change and none of these changed.

17:07.350 --> 17:13.270
That's because if you change anything in a child component that's actually going to override that change.

17:13.320 --> 17:17.430
And when you change the master component now if you change the size it'll change the size of all of

17:17.430 --> 17:18.100
these.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.670
But it won't change this because you've overridden that size.

17:21.870 --> 17:28.380
If you want to ever change this back you can double click inside of this text area and you can go back

17:28.800 --> 17:34.730
into this little button here this instance button and you can choose to reset all overwrites.

17:34.740 --> 17:40.110
So right now we overrode the name so we typed in 22 and that's different in the master component.

17:40.110 --> 17:46.080
We overrode the text we overrode the textile so we can choose to not reset the text but we can reset

17:46.090 --> 17:47.110
that style.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.340
And that brings it back down and we could reset the name if we wanted.

17:50.340 --> 17:56.300
But I'm just going to leave that and I can see that these are sitting a little bit high to the circles

17:56.310 --> 17:59.590
on the right click and go to master component again.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.120
And if I double click on this text.

18:02.310 --> 18:05.840
Let's just have this sit down just a little bit something like this.

18:05.850 --> 18:09.410
Let's jump back into our pages and see if that looks better.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.860
I think that looks a little bit better here.

18:11.880 --> 18:19.350
So now going down the list I'm going to just change this to four and let's say that these steps are

18:19.350 --> 18:20.020
complete here.

18:20.020 --> 18:27.690
So I'm just going to mark this is complete and the first few steps we'll just say are complete here.

18:31.550 --> 18:33.930
Little Linus here with the top of this text

18:39.540 --> 18:45.660
and let's say it's all but the last is complete and these are a little bit too many steps.

18:45.870 --> 18:49.770
So I know if you try to follow this recipe you're probably going to screw up because I'm going to delete

18:49.830 --> 18:51.720
a bunch of mid text inside of here.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.020
But this is just for visual representation.

18:54.510 --> 18:59.190
And I don't want the art board to be that long so I'm just changing this just deleting the little bit

18:59.190 --> 19:00.560
of these steps.

19:00.660 --> 19:03.990
So let's just have you know three or four steps here.

19:03.990 --> 19:11.070
So three of them are completed and this fourth one is not.

19:11.190 --> 19:15.450
Now I want to make sure things are lined up correctly so I'm going to hold down option b c there's 31

19:15.450 --> 19:16.150
pixels here.

19:16.170 --> 19:22.230
I actually want to nudge this so there's only 20 pixels here then I want 10 pixels to be in between

19:22.230 --> 19:27.670
here and I just want to hold down shift and nudge at once.

19:27.720 --> 19:33.440
And now we have 10 pixels and then I want this side to be 20 pixels so I'm going to hold down command

19:33.780 --> 19:37.490
and nudge this one two three four five six.

19:37.560 --> 19:37.820
OK.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.330
So everything looks good.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.430
And we have our steps.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.330
Now zoom out here and take a look at this.

19:47.370 --> 19:49.840
This is all looking really good now.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.370
And to match the lining here this shows 14 by 14.

19:54.420 --> 20:00.990
I'm just going to line this here with the edge here and then nudge this holding now command left arrow

20:00.990 --> 20:04.800
left arrow and command shift left arrow once more.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.630
So we have a 20 by 20 so we can see this is a line really good.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.170
And go into a line.

20:11.170 --> 20:17.180
The ease with the edges here.

20:17.460 --> 20:23.310
So those are components we've now converted all of our icons to components here and they're ready to

20:23.310 --> 20:26.490
be reused throughout all of the other designs.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.880
For example I'm just going to hold down option here and I'll just move this over here because I know

20:29.880 --> 20:34.230
we're going to use the same kind of five star scheme inside of this design in the future.

20:35.990 --> 20:41.780
Again now if we click on this components panel you can see all of our components here.

20:41.780 --> 20:49.210
We have six components on our home page and we have three components here under the components background.
