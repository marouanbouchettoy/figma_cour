1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,250
In most cases nowadays we're designing for multiple device screens.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,770
And this starts to become a challenge translating how the paddings and margins and layout will look

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,150
to the developers as they're developing these screens for the different device sizes.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,990
Well Fishman has a really nice tool to help this become much easier to export multiple screen sizes

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,080
and not having to design for multiple screens but using constraints so you can stretch this frame and

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,610
see exactly what it's going to look like at that size.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,370
And you'll notice when I stretch this right now things look a little bit broken and they're not exactly

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,370
resizing the right way or the way that you would intend.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,070
So I'm going to click command Z and that's what we're going to do as we're going to set up this frame

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,450
here to be responsive.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,870
We're going to set up a constraints for all of these elements.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,150
Now before we do that I'm going to just zoom into these two art boards here and I want to just hold

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:04,150
down option and copy some elements over here to kind of complete this design and move this down here

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,410
and I have this centered.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,580
And if we were really focusing on this design I would get the padding exactly right and the spacing.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,870
But just to save some time I'm just going to eyeball this and we can work on that a little bit later.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,130
Now I'm going to add just a few more elements here.

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm going to hold down option and copy this up here to be aligned with the center of these icons.

19
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:40,030
I'm going to call this popular recipes and make this the same red color here and go down once more.

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,530
We call this entrees over here.

21
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,660
Appetisers hold down option once more and call this dessert.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:03,810
And I want these to be subtle gray here and will probably make this thirteen point and regular

23
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:16,000
and because this is the one that is selected right now I'm going to make this black and medium and using

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,370
the L key I'm going to draw a line just below this and let's make this two pixels and let's cap off

25
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,220
the ends with a rounded.

26
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,510
And here I'm just going to give this going to center this command g to group it and center it with the

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,010
board and then all ungroup here.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,310
Shift command G and I'll give these 30 pixels in between each mesh just nudging the U.S. holding down

29
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,850
the shift and the arrow keys.

30
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,210
So now if I hold down option you can see that there's 30 pixels in between.

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,400
And we can easily see the entrées are selected as change in the sizing and the padding here.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,270
It really doesn't matter too much you can move this around however you want.

33
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,290
And I think the last thing I want to do is hold down command G and center this with the board shift

34
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,580
command to ungroup.

35
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,330
So now we have this design near completed and we want to make this responsive.

36
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,040
So the first thing we do is test this out.

37
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,320
We can see that things are broken here.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,980
So going down one by one let's just fix this top area right here.

39
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,670
So we know we want this icon to be constrained to the top left of this frame.

40
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,220
So now when we try this we can see that's exactly what we want it to do here.

41
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,300
We're going to hit command Z to resize this back to where it was.

42
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:48,430
And now this popular recipes we want to center this with the frame and instead of the left top we want

43
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,570
this to just be centered and we want it to sit at the top and sitting at the top means if I scale this

44
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,030
down it's just going to stay there.

45
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:06,430
If I change this to sit at the center what is going to do is center this where it's at here between

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,040
the top and the bottom.

47
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,150
So change back to top center.

48
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,320
And then this guy right here is going to be right top.

49
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,750
So now we have our Hetter area behave exactly how it should.

50
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,790
And now we have to deal with these guys.

51
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:32,310
So if I want to apply a constraint to everything I can select all of these layers and click command

52
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,400
G or control G on the windows and I'm going to name this categories.

53
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,670
And now I want this also to be centered and sit at the top.

54
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,400
So now we have this group as centered.

55
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,500
And we can resize this and we can see that it is centering each element on the artwork but that's not

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,240
exactly what we want.

57
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,030
It's centering relative to this frame.

58
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,700
But if you want to create a new frame around this we chose to group this and we named this group category.

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,740
But let's convert this group to its own frame.

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,290
And this is what we call a frame within a frame so that we can set the constraints only within this

61
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,070
frame and is independent of what we said in this frame.

62
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,130
So I'm going to click on this group and you can see that it's a group here but I can change this to

63
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,790
a frame instantly by clicking on frame right here.

64
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,440
And so now this has its own frame.

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,810
And these objects are going to be centered within this frame itself not within this frame.

66
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,690
So now we have a left top constraint here.

67
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,240
We're going to center this frame for the top and center.

68
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,630
And now when we stretch this we can see that's precisely what we want to have happen there.

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,080
Command Z and now we're working our way up to these images here.

70
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:05,440
So I can group these items command G because they want these to stay within each other and I want this

71
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,480
to be center top when we can see that that behaves correctly.

72
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,340
And now let's move these images inside of that same group.

73
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,740
So we have this group up here.

74
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,790
I'm going to select both of these with Option Command and right bracket I'm going to move these to the

75
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,280
top near this other one.

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,660
So now we have these two mass groups and this group I'm going to move to the top as well.

77
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,080
And holding down command and selecting both of these I mean just to move them inside of this group here.

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,750
So now we have all of these grouped.

79
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,580
And same thing center top

80
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:06,740
and again we have to convert this into its own frame.

81
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,400
So now that's working correctly.

82
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,160
And we have this component works the same way as a frame where we can just choose to create this at

83
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,760
the top center and it's not going to stretch like a group does.

84
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,050
Now I can resize this that always stays centered on the same thing over here so you can select multiple

85
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,750
things at once if you know they're going to have the same alignment properties and just going to make

86
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,910
sure that this is already centered on the board.

87
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,900
Here we go.

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,220
And again the center top and these are the last things here.

89
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,250
So first of all just making sure that it has the right spacing that you want initially

90
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,890
that's probably pretty good.

91
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,750
Move these down just a tiny bit.

92
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:13,950
And now I can select all of these commands read a group change this group into a frame and let's center

93
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,960
this last thing.

94
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,440
But this text we actually want this to be pinned to the left and right.

95
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,910
So we wanted to always be 20 pixels on the left 20 pixels on the right and same thing here.

96
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,020
We can actually stretch this here depending on if the text increases or decreases.

97
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,540
We still want to have 20 pixels on the left and right.

98
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,020
So we're going to choose left and right here and now check this out.

99
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,900
This is for the iPhone 8.

100
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,380
If you want to look at the eight plus we can look at that very easily.

101
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:57,180
Look at the iPhone 5 s or if we have the galaxy note or whatever we can change the size and very easily

102
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,290
your developers can see exactly what you intend this to look like during development for multiple screen

103
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,680
sizes.

104
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,940
You can also change the width here so 375 and you have the option here because it's turned into a frame.

105
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,190
I can decide I want to see what it looks like on the Galaxy S8 that changes proportionately.

106
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,560
And the same thing I can choose maybe a 7 inch tablet What does that look like here.

107
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,550
So you can see that you have that nice web for the 7 inch tablet.

108
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,230
We're going to change this back to the iPhone 8.

109
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,830
So once you get the hang of setting up constraints it's just a matter of testing things once you set

110
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,320
them up making sure that things are flowing correctly and once you really do get the hang of this it

111
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,780
takes probably two minutes to convert something like this into a responsive design.

112
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,280
So before we move into the next video I would like you to go through this our board here.

113
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,390
This may be a little bit simpler to set some things like this up.

114
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm going to just Center this but just go through here and just set the constraints here for this frame.

115
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,450
And again you can always test it out by just stretching things you can already see that some things

116
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,980
are broken like this image here.

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,240
So if I hit undo this image would just be pinned left to right or left and right.

118
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,550
And we can see that.

119
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,930
Now that's fixed.

120
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,080
So just go through and change some of those things on your own and see if you can get this to behave

121
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,930
and perform the way that you'd like.
