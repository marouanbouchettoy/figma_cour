00:00.810 --> 00:05.250
In most cases nowadays we're designing for multiple device screens.

00:05.430 --> 00:10.770
And this starts to become a challenge translating how the paddings and margins and layout will look

00:10.770 --> 00:15.150
to the developers as they're developing these screens for the different device sizes.

00:15.300 --> 00:21.990
Well Fishman has a really nice tool to help this become much easier to export multiple screen sizes

00:22.140 --> 00:28.080
and not having to design for multiple screens but using constraints so you can stretch this frame and

00:28.080 --> 00:30.610
see exactly what it's going to look like at that size.

00:30.870 --> 00:35.370
And you'll notice when I stretch this right now things look a little bit broken and they're not exactly

00:35.370 --> 00:38.370
resizing the right way or the way that you would intend.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.070
So I'm going to click command Z and that's what we're going to do as we're going to set up this frame

00:44.070 --> 00:45.450
here to be responsive.

00:45.450 --> 00:48.870
We're going to set up a constraints for all of these elements.

00:49.320 --> 00:54.150
Now before we do that I'm going to just zoom into these two art boards here and I want to just hold

00:54.150 --> 01:04.150
down option and copy some elements over here to kind of complete this design and move this down here

01:04.580 --> 01:06.410
and I have this centered.

01:07.140 --> 01:12.580
And if we were really focusing on this design I would get the padding exactly right and the spacing.

01:12.720 --> 01:19.870
But just to save some time I'm just going to eyeball this and we can work on that a little bit later.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.130
Now I'm going to add just a few more elements here.

01:22.130 --> 01:27.760
I'm going to hold down option and copy this up here to be aligned with the center of these icons.

01:27.810 --> 01:40.030
I'm going to call this popular recipes and make this the same red color here and go down once more.

01:40.440 --> 01:45.530
We call this entrees over here.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.660
Appetisers hold down option once more and call this dessert.

01:52.920 --> 02:03.810
And I want these to be subtle gray here and will probably make this thirteen point and regular

02:08.050 --> 02:16.000
and because this is the one that is selected right now I'm going to make this black and medium and using

02:16.000 --> 02:24.370
the L key I'm going to draw a line just below this and let's make this two pixels and let's cap off

02:24.370 --> 02:26.220
the ends with a rounded.

02:26.740 --> 02:34.510
And here I'm just going to give this going to center this command g to group it and center it with the

02:34.660 --> 02:37.010
board and then all ungroup here.

02:37.120 --> 02:45.310
Shift command G and I'll give these 30 pixels in between each mesh just nudging the U.S. holding down

02:45.310 --> 02:47.850
the shift and the arrow keys.

02:47.860 --> 02:51.210
So now if I hold down option you can see that there's 30 pixels in between.

02:51.400 --> 02:57.400
And we can easily see the entrÃ©es are selected as change in the sizing and the padding here.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.270
It really doesn't matter too much you can move this around however you want.

03:01.470 --> 03:08.290
And I think the last thing I want to do is hold down command G and center this with the board shift

03:08.290 --> 03:09.580
command to ungroup.

03:09.580 --> 03:15.330
So now we have this design near completed and we want to make this responsive.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.040
So the first thing we do is test this out.

03:17.050 --> 03:19.320
We can see that things are broken here.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.980
So going down one by one let's just fix this top area right here.

03:24.190 --> 03:29.670
So we know we want this icon to be constrained to the top left of this frame.

03:30.010 --> 03:36.220
So now when we try this we can see that's exactly what we want it to do here.

03:36.370 --> 03:40.300
We're going to hit command Z to resize this back to where it was.

03:40.300 --> 03:48.430
And now this popular recipes we want to center this with the frame and instead of the left top we want

03:48.430 --> 03:55.570
this to just be centered and we want it to sit at the top and sitting at the top means if I scale this

03:55.570 --> 03:58.030
down it's just going to stay there.

03:58.600 --> 04:06.430
If I change this to sit at the center what is going to do is center this where it's at here between

04:06.430 --> 04:08.040
the top and the bottom.

04:08.070 --> 04:11.150
So change back to top center.

04:11.410 --> 04:15.320
And then this guy right here is going to be right top.

04:15.700 --> 04:20.750
So now we have our Hetter area behave exactly how it should.

04:21.580 --> 04:24.790
And now we have to deal with these guys.

04:24.790 --> 04:32.310
So if I want to apply a constraint to everything I can select all of these layers and click command

04:32.310 --> 04:38.400
G or control G on the windows and I'm going to name this categories.

04:39.850 --> 04:44.670
And now I want this also to be centered and sit at the top.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.400
So now we have this group as centered.

04:47.590 --> 04:53.500
And we can resize this and we can see that it is centering each element on the artwork but that's not

04:53.500 --> 04:55.240
exactly what we want.

04:55.450 --> 04:58.030
It's centering relative to this frame.

04:58.150 --> 05:05.700
But if you want to create a new frame around this we chose to group this and we named this group category.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.740
But let's convert this group to its own frame.

05:08.740 --> 05:14.290
And this is what we call a frame within a frame so that we can set the constraints only within this

05:14.290 --> 05:18.070
frame and is independent of what we said in this frame.

05:18.220 --> 05:24.130
So I'm going to click on this group and you can see that it's a group here but I can change this to

05:24.130 --> 05:27.790
a frame instantly by clicking on frame right here.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.440
And so now this has its own frame.

05:30.730 --> 05:36.810
And these objects are going to be centered within this frame itself not within this frame.

05:37.090 --> 05:40.690
So now we have a left top constraint here.

05:40.780 --> 05:44.240
We're going to center this frame for the top and center.

05:44.650 --> 05:50.630
And now when we stretch this we can see that's precisely what we want to have happen there.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.080
Command Z and now we're working our way up to these images here.

05:56.140 --> 06:05.440
So I can group these items command G because they want these to stay within each other and I want this

06:05.740 --> 06:12.480
to be center top when we can see that that behaves correctly.

06:12.670 --> 06:16.340
And now let's move these images inside of that same group.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.740
So we have this group up here.

06:19.990 --> 06:24.790
I'm going to select both of these with Option Command and right bracket I'm going to move these to the

06:24.790 --> 06:29.280
top near this other one.

06:29.400 --> 06:34.660
So now we have these two mass groups and this group I'm going to move to the top as well.

06:37.080 --> 06:44.080
And holding down command and selecting both of these I mean just to move them inside of this group here.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.750
So now we have all of these grouped.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.580
And same thing center top

06:55.330 --> 07:06.740
and again we have to convert this into its own frame.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.400
So now that's working correctly.

07:12.250 --> 07:18.160
And we have this component works the same way as a frame where we can just choose to create this at

07:18.160 --> 07:22.760
the top center and it's not going to stretch like a group does.

07:23.950 --> 07:29.050
Now I can resize this that always stays centered on the same thing over here so you can select multiple

07:29.050 --> 07:34.750
things at once if you know they're going to have the same alignment properties and just going to make

07:34.750 --> 07:36.910
sure that this is already centered on the board.

07:36.910 --> 07:40.900
Here we go.

07:40.900 --> 07:47.220
And again the center top and these are the last things here.

07:48.220 --> 07:54.250
So first of all just making sure that it has the right spacing that you want initially

07:58.460 --> 08:00.890
that's probably pretty good.

08:03.070 --> 08:05.750
Move these down just a tiny bit.

08:05.790 --> 08:13.950
And now I can select all of these commands read a group change this group into a frame and let's center

08:13.950 --> 08:15.960
this last thing.

08:15.960 --> 08:22.440
But this text we actually want this to be pinned to the left and right.

08:22.530 --> 08:28.910
So we wanted to always be 20 pixels on the left 20 pixels on the right and same thing here.

08:28.920 --> 08:35.020
We can actually stretch this here depending on if the text increases or decreases.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.540
We still want to have 20 pixels on the left and right.

08:37.890 --> 08:43.020
So we're going to choose left and right here and now check this out.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.900
This is for the iPhone 8.

08:44.940 --> 08:48.380
If you want to look at the eight plus we can look at that very easily.

08:48.540 --> 08:57.180
Look at the iPhone 5 s or if we have the galaxy note or whatever we can change the size and very easily

08:57.480 --> 09:04.290
your developers can see exactly what you intend this to look like during development for multiple screen

09:04.290 --> 09:06.680
sizes.

09:06.810 --> 09:12.940
You can also change the width here so 375 and you have the option here because it's turned into a frame.

09:13.200 --> 09:19.190
I can decide I want to see what it looks like on the Galaxy S8 that changes proportionately.

09:19.290 --> 09:23.560
And the same thing I can choose maybe a 7 inch tablet What does that look like here.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.550
So you can see that you have that nice web for the 7 inch tablet.

09:27.780 --> 09:34.230
We're going to change this back to the iPhone 8.

09:34.280 --> 09:39.830
So once you get the hang of setting up constraints it's just a matter of testing things once you set

09:39.830 --> 09:45.320
them up making sure that things are flowing correctly and once you really do get the hang of this it

09:45.320 --> 09:50.780
takes probably two minutes to convert something like this into a responsive design.

09:51.080 --> 09:55.280
So before we move into the next video I would like you to go through this our board here.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.390
This may be a little bit simpler to set some things like this up.

09:58.400 --> 10:04.720
I'm going to just Center this but just go through here and just set the constraints here for this frame.

10:04.820 --> 10:08.450
And again you can always test it out by just stretching things you can already see that some things

10:08.450 --> 10:10.980
are broken like this image here.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.240
So if I hit undo this image would just be pinned left to right or left and right.

10:18.590 --> 10:19.550
And we can see that.

10:19.550 --> 10:20.930
Now that's fixed.

10:20.930 --> 10:27.080
So just go through and change some of those things on your own and see if you can get this to behave

10:27.080 --> 10:28.930
and perform the way that you'd like.
