Because FEMA's design files live on the cloud you don't have the conventional safe features that you'd

00:05.420 --> 00:07.840
do in normal local files.

00:07.860 --> 00:13.500
You can click on file and export here to export certain files but for the most part once the Enigma

00:13.500 --> 00:20.010
file lives inside of your figure the instance and you have collaborators designing with you everything

00:20.010 --> 00:22.260
is just saved instantly.

00:22.260 --> 00:27.750
Now there may be time if you want to jump back inside of your history and find a certain way that you

00:27.750 --> 00:30.180
may have styled something that you want to retain.

00:30.270 --> 00:33.390
And that's where versioning control comes in with Sigma.

00:33.540 --> 00:39.030
So we have this file here version control and to go into your version control just click on this little

00:39.030 --> 00:44.730
arrow here right next to the file name and you can see the show version history.

00:44.730 --> 00:49.310
So if I click on here you can see a few snapshots of time where I've designed this.

00:49.440 --> 00:55.230
And you may not see the same version history and that's because once I click file export to export this

00:55.230 --> 01:01.950
into the exercise files then it suppresses or hides all of these versions and you only get the latest

01:01.950 --> 01:03.460
state.

01:03.540 --> 01:09.690
These versions only pertain to after you load this into Sigma and you begin designing with it so very

01:09.690 --> 01:19.130
easily I can click and see what this looks like a 12:26 PM or a 10:54 PM or December 17th for example.

01:19.260 --> 01:25.680
So you can click in and see the progress here and if there's something that you like within this design

01:26.940 --> 01:28.850
you can duplicate this instance.

01:28.860 --> 01:35.100
So duplicate this file to show just this instance and you can copy and paste some things back and forth.

01:35.190 --> 01:38.570
Or you can restore the file if you say this is the latest version that I like.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.370
I don't like what I've done in the last hour.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.790
You can change that and just restore this actual file to this version.

01:45.870 --> 01:48.270
And then again you can see the current version here.

01:48.450 --> 01:55.140
So that's versioning history and if you notice the notes down here you have a 30 day version history.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.510
And if you want more than that you'll have to upgrade to the paid program once you're done checking

02:00.510 --> 02:00.890
this out.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.610
You can click back to editing and begin editing where you left off.
