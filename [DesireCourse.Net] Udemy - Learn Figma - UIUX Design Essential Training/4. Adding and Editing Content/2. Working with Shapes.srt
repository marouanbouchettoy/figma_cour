1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,100
Let's begin adding in combining shapes to our design here and we'll start off with this splash screen.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,660
So if you just hold down Z and draw a rectangle you can zoom into the splash screen and the first thing

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,500
I want to do inside of this black frame is draw a rectangle that's the same size as the frame here.

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,640
And the reason why I want to do this is to change the fill color to this default red.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,260
But I also want to display an image inside of this shape.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,310
So I can click on this feel again and I can feel this shape with an image and here it's going to ask

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,360
me to choose the image and under the assets folder you can choose any of these images that you'd like.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,530
I'm going to choose this entree lasagna J peck here so I can click open and you can see that that's

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,540
now the background of this frame.

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,210
But I want to move this image field down below this color fill.

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,800
Now I want to change the opacity of this red field to 90 percent.

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:06,090
And I actually want to hide the layout grid here to make this little bit easier to see.

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,160
And so we have our first shape it's this rectangle here if we click and drag you can see this rectangle

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,420
snaps to the frame edges and with rectangles or other shapes you can click on these radius anchors to

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,020
expand or decrease the radius of this shape.

16
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,440
And if you want to manipulate the individual radiuses of this shape you can hold down option and drag

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,030
and that will only drag the radius in and out.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,590
Just for that one corner we're going to leave those the same here.

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,630
And now let's create a chef's hat icon so we can do this by using a few ellipses.

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,940
So I'll just draw some.

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:54,690
I'll hold down shift so I can constrain the width and the height and let's just drag this out something

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,330
like this and I'll hold down shift to select all of these guys and make sure everything is distributed

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,680
correctly.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,650
And I'm just going to zoom in just a little bit more here and this is going to take some playing around

25
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,170
with so maybe I will select the circle and if you hold down shift in the up arrow key it will nudge

26
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,630
this about 10 pixels each time that you hit the arrow key.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,010
So I've just nudged this up 20 pixels.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,980
I've got a nice shape here and now I'll draw a rectangle here.

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,300
For the bottom area of the hat I'm going to move this around just a little bit.

30
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,230
And now if I want I can click hold down shift and select these three circles which is going to group

31
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,540
these for now so that when I hold down shift and select this rectangle I can align everything to the

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,230
center.

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,800
Make sure everything's aligned really good and I'll just hold down shift command g to ungroup everything

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,080
now so we can see these shapes.

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,450
We have three circles and one rectangle and that's making up our chef's hat.

36
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,940
Now with this chef's hat I actually want the corners here to have a radius so I can do that by clicking

37
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,840
on this radius.

38
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,940
Anchor and change in that I think 7 pixels looks good.

39
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,050
And we have the starting of our chefs hat already.

40
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,310
So all we need to do at this point is select all of these shapes by holding down shift three simple

41
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,500
shapes and we can come up here and we can see some settings for joining some shapes together for subtracting

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,200
them and you can play around with these to create some nice combination effects for simple shapes.

43
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,610
So I'm just going to use the union selection and now we have a one simple shape.

44
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:47,010
I can change the fill color of this shape if I wanted or I could even remove the feel of this shape

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,290
and add a stroke and the stroke.

46
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's make this white and let's say I want this to be 10 pixels.

47
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:01,560
So we have this acting as one shape here but I can still double quick to drill down into this and you

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,260
can see that it is actually behaving as four different shapes that are joined together so I can still

49
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,480
tweak this a little bit and give it a little bit more personality if I wanted make these a tiny bit

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,140
on even

51
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,830
which is very handy to make some subtle changes there.

52
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,400
The last thing I'm going to do for this shape so click in the shapes tool and create a line and I'm

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,590
just going to click and drag holding down shift and I want to copy the same style so I'm going to write

54
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,360
click here and copy style and I'll right click on this image.

55
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,230
And paste this style.

56
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,430
So we have a nice pasted style but I want the ends of this line to be rounded so I can jump into the

57
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,290
advanced menu of The Strokes and decide that I want the cap to be rounded.

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,750
I've got a nice rounded effect and now I'm just going to select this line.

59
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,460
Hold down option and just drag down to get just one more line below that.

60
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,940
And now I want to join all of this as one shape.

61
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,170
So I'm going to hold down Shift while I'm selecting these two lines and this one shape.

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
And now that I have these three selected I can hit command G.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,530
And that will all be grouped into one shape.

64
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,320
Now please scroll down and move over into the home frame.

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,550
There are a few other icons that we can recreate with basic shapes here as well.

66
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,120
So I'll just zoom into the top area here for some navigation icons and we want to search icon here on

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,430
the home page and also a menu icon.

68
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,010
So the menu icon can be very simple.

69
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:51,630
I can go back into the shapes tool and click on rectangle and here I'm just going to quickly draw a

70
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,630
hamburger menu.

71
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,550
So going to hold down option here and copy this leave in six pixels in between and we can see that this

72
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,680
shape is 41 pixels by six pixels.

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,150
Now I just make this an even 40 by selecting all of these rectangles and choosing 40 pixels in the design

74
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,610
panel and then I want us to have a little bit more personality so I'm going to just decrease the size

75
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,290
of these a little bit.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,450
To make their menu icon look a little bit staggered.

77
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:30,000
And the last thing I want to do here is I actually want bees radiuses here on the right side to be curved.

78
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,400
So zooming in here I want to do that and curve these edges what I can do is select all three of these

79
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,010
rectangles and I can change the radius here if I change this to 3 pixels so you can see that everything

80
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,440
changes to three pixels.

81
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,500
But what if I want to individually change the pixel sizes on each corner.

82
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:55,320
Well I'm going to undo this and here this gives me control to change the radius for each corner starting

83
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,470
with the top left.

84
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,440
So the top left we know we want to be zero and the top right.

85
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,810
We want to be three pixels and the bottom right.

86
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,940
We want to be three pixels and then we want the bottom left to stay zero pixels.

87
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,350
So we have our hamburger menu here and we can group this as well by just selecting everything and choosing

88
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,780
Union selection.

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:27,770
And now we have this one icon here I can change all of it to be black red whatever color that I want

90
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,430
here.

91
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,520
So now we want to create a magnifying glass and we can do that by going into the shape's options here.

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm going to click on the elipse tool and holding down shift or just drag and draw an ellipse and we'll

93
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,690
start out with 23 pixels I think that's good.

94
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,360
And we can actually remove the fill here by selecting on the outside of this row clicking the subtract

95
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,610
and then we'll add a stroke.

96
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,600
And we want the stroke to be red.

97
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,220
And I think inside the stroke is good we can align this to the outside of the middle or the inside we're

98
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,640
going to keep it on the inside.

99
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,010
And I'm going to have the stroke wait be two pixels here.

100
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,270
Now I'm going to draw a rectangle.

101
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:21,890
And now four pixels is good maybe four pixels by 10 or 12 and we can change this later if we want.

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,740
And the feel of this brunette changed to be the same red color and I'm just going to slit both of these

103
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,010
and align them.

104
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,940
So we have two simple shapes here and you'll notice when I tried to align this this has 23 pixels but

105
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,070
this has four pixels so we have an even with an odd with which is making it look a little bit staggered

106
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,270
sort of change that.

107
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,350
I'm just going to change the width of this to 20 pixels.

108
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,170
So they're both even all do in a line again.

109
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,070
And that's just nudge this up with our arrow keys.

110
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,800
Now one thing that you can do with rectangles or circles or any other shape.

111
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,000
If I zoom in here I can select this rectangle and if I hold down command with my arrow keys I can nudge

112
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,720
up or down and it will decrease or increase the size whether that's the height or if I use the right

113
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,030
or left arrows it's the width.

114
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,200
So it's a very nice shortcut to nudge the sizes to get it precisely the way that you want.

115
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,890
Now I'm going to add just a small radius here of one pixel around we have a nice rounded corners on

116
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,860
this magnifying glass and the last thing we can do is select this fill in this stroke and choose union

117
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,710
selection and actually combines this stroke with the fill which makes it quite nice.

118
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,110
Now by double click inside of here.

119
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,760
Hold down shift to select this circle.

120
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,630
I'm just going to rotate the both of these at 45 degrees and hit return.

121
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,920
And now we have this shape the shape shows twenty five point eight five pixels and we want it to be

122
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,720
an even 40 pixels so I can click here to constrain the proportions and choose this to be 40 pixels.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,690
And now if I hold down command and zoom out with my scroll will you can see that that's proportionally

124
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,420
the same width as this hamburger menu.

125
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:22,240
So I'm going to bring this over here and we have a nice starting out of a hamburger menu and a magnifying

126
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
glass menu with some basic simple shapes.

127
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,610
Now in the same home page we can tap our for rectangle and if I hold down the ship I can strain the

128
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,070
size of this.

129
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,570
We want this rectangle to be 2:21 by 2:21 So we'll just match it with the columns here.

130
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,640
And this is going to be where image is going to live.

131
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,920
But to the top right of this image we're going to have a heart icon.

132
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,850
So I'm going to just zoom in here and to draw a heart.

133
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm going to click and drag a.

134
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,590
I'll start out with 10 pixel by 15 pixel here.

135
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,500
And I'll make this white so you can see it.

136
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,900
And the first thing we can do is change the radius of this heart is going to be one side of the heart

137
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,350
here.

138
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,780
So the top left is going to be five pixels the top right is going to be five pixels.

139
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:15,210
And then these two at the bottom are going to be zero pixels now I can hold down option and copy the

140
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,710
shape I'm going to rotate this 90 degrees holding down shift.

141
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,950
Not going to line this here.

142
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,050
You can see we have a nice heart.

143
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,210
So now I will select both of these shapes.

144
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,670
Rotate this forty five degrees for our heart shape.

145
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,840
And the last thing we want to do is hit this Join button and now we have a heart icon.

146
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,560
And I want to change the feel of this to be removed.

147
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm going to add a stroke and this will be a white stroke.

148
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
And let's try to pixels here.

149
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,560
Now if I hold down command and zoom out you can see what that looks like and how this sits in relation

150
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,940
to this image that we're going to have so I can set this to that top right here.

151
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,980
And then instead of using my x and y values here to nudge this around I can hold down shift and just

152
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,960
nudge this left 10 pixels and down 10 pixels and it's sitting nicely now inside of this image.

153
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,640
If you ever want to see the sizing or the relationship of sizing between two devices you can select

154
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,940
this heart for example and then just hold down option and you'll get these nice red indicators of how

155
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,880
many pixels are between the edges of certain elements and you can see here because the shape is on some

156
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,640
pixels.

157
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,060
This notched nine point nine three pixels if you want to change that to be an even width you can lock

158
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,290
proportions here.

159
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,390
And let's just change this to maybe be 20 pixels wide.

160
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,870
You can change that.

161
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,160
And now let's try this again solemnised at the top right.

162
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,900
Hold down shift and left and down arrow.

163
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,470
Now one last thing you might notice when we increase the size here that doesn't increase the radius.

164
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:02,420
What we should have done if we undo this a little bit is go to the scale tool and now using the scale

165
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,630
tool you can scale this up and down and the radius will also scale with it the way that we did it before

166
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,020
is to actually use the Move tool and tried scaling this which resizes.

167
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:20,590
But you can see those radiuses still stay about five pixels if you ever did accidently resize it this

168
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,480
way.

169
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,040
And we can see that those radiuses haven't scaled.

170
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,190
You can always double click inside of here.

171
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,420
Hold down shift and then just make a quick change maybe.

172
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,180
So these 10 pixels now and you can see a nice rounded radius.

173
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,760
So it's really nice to show you how to troubleshoot these things too because it'll always come up as

174
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,040
your scale on things you might wonder why the radiuses or the strokes aren't looking good.

175
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,860
So there's a big difference between just resizing and using that scale tool.

176
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,760
So now we know we want a five star rating system for our recipe.

177
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,520
And under the shape's options we have the star tool that's really handy.

178
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,220
So I'm going to just click and drag and hold down shift to lock my ratio and I can drag this any size

179
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,870
that I want.

180
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,450
And later I can come in here lock my proportions.

181
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm just going to make the 16 pixels wide here and let's zoom in so I can either keep this style that

182
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,060
is given me.

183
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,600
But I have a few controls to change the style to how I want this to look.

184
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,140
And one of those is changing the counts here I can change this to three four five or 30 count and I

185
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,160
can also change the ratios to if I want to give these points a little bit more bolder I can do that

186
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,930
with this ratio anchor and that I have a radius control and I'll just zoom in here a little bit to show

187
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,960
you how this radius control works.

188
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:51,720
So if I push this down you can see I have an option for one or two pixel radius and so that seems like

189
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,450
a bit much.

190
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,990
So if you want something that's more subtle than that you can still go into this design panel and I'll

191
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:04,380
just type Point 2 ratio just for a nice soft point here unless the I want to change this field to be

192
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:11,250
a little bit lighter because this is the background to the star and I'm going to zoom out and holding

193
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,500
down option.

194
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,450
I'll just copy this four times.

195
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,180
And we know with this particular recipe is going to be four and a half stars so I'm going to select

196
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,520
four of these stars make them red.

197
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,880
But how do we get half of this star to be red.

198
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,260
Well if you hold down option and copy this we've seen that we can combine shapes but we can also subtract

199
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,800
shapes.

200
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,410
So we have this star and we want to subtract a rectangle from the star.

201
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,600
So I'm just going to drag a rectangle here we're going to snap it to the very center of this star and

202
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,550
I'm going to turn down the opacity here just to show you what's happening.

203
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,080
So we have this rectangle that's overlain this star.

204
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,140
And so now when I select these two simple shapes I can go in here and I can still use this union selection.

205
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,430
But that just gives me one really weird shape.

206
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,030
Or I can click in this down arrow and you subtract selection to subtract the rectangle from the star

207
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,130
which gives me a nice half star.

208
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,760
If you'd like to see what the other options do you can play around with that by just clicking undo.

209
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,660
And we'll go and use exclude selection which will exclude anything that's intersecting between the two

210
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,670
selections.

211
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,240
And we also have intersect.

212
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,150
So anything that's the intersecting it will give us that right half of the star.

213
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,330
So there's multiple ways that we can join or subtract shapes together.

214
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,610
I'm just going to stick with this subtract selection here.

215
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:52,550
And now I want to copy this style and paste the style on this star and we see very easily we have this

216
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,700
nice four and a half stars.

217
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,320
Now you can see here the star isn't quite a line and that's because instead of being a nice even 16

218
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,050
by 16 pixels now will be cut it in half.

219
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,840
It has a 7.3 by thirteen point eighty five pixels in here.

220
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,180
So if we want to align this we can still get past this by double clicking inside of here and we'll just

221
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,880
select both of these shapes inside of this join.

222
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,240
And once we click both of the shapes we can snap this to align with other shapes.

223
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,320
It's just a weird quirk but learning how to get past things like this will really help you save time

224
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,940
and align things.

225
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,440
Now zoom out here to see the finished result.

226
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,320
And we can select all of these shapes and use command g to group all of them and just make sure they're

227
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,620
centered here on the frame.

228
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:45,140
Now these are just a few ways that we can use shapes you see that we created a nice icon here hamburger

229
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:53,300
menu search icon and this hurt here learning how to use the shapes tools and also the bully on tools

230
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,390
that we see here.

231
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,770
Give you a lot of power in creating the icons that you'd like.
