WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:06.100
Let's begin adding in combining shapes to our design here and we'll start off with this splash screen.

00:06.350 --> 00:11.660
So if you just hold down Z and draw a rectangle you can zoom into the splash screen and the first thing

00:11.660 --> 00:17.500
I want to do inside of this black frame is draw a rectangle that's the same size as the frame here.

00:19.210 --> 00:23.640
And the reason why I want to do this is to change the fill color to this default red.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.260
But I also want to display an image inside of this shape.

00:28.900 --> 00:35.310
So I can click on this feel again and I can feel this shape with an image and here it's going to ask

00:35.310 --> 00:42.360
me to choose the image and under the assets folder you can choose any of these images that you'd like.

00:42.420 --> 00:49.530
I'm going to choose this entree lasagna J peck here so I can click open and you can see that that's

00:49.530 --> 00:51.540
now the background of this frame.

00:51.630 --> 00:55.210
But I want to move this image field down below this color fill.

00:55.290 --> 00:59.800
Now I want to change the opacity of this red field to 90 percent.

00:59.970 --> 01:06.090
And I actually want to hide the layout grid here to make this little bit easier to see.

01:07.810 --> 01:12.160
And so we have our first shape it's this rectangle here if we click and drag you can see this rectangle

01:12.160 --> 01:19.420
snaps to the frame edges and with rectangles or other shapes you can click on these radius anchors to

01:19.420 --> 01:23.020
expand or decrease the radius of this shape.

01:23.170 --> 01:29.440
And if you want to manipulate the individual radiuses of this shape you can hold down option and drag

01:29.440 --> 01:32.030
and that will only drag the radius in and out.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.590
Just for that one corner we're going to leave those the same here.

01:36.540 --> 01:43.630
And now let's create a chef's hat icon so we can do this by using a few ellipses.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.940
So I'll just draw some.

01:45.940 --> 01:54.690
I'll hold down shift so I can constrain the width and the height and let's just drag this out something

01:54.690 --> 02:00.330
like this and I'll hold down shift to select all of these guys and make sure everything is distributed

02:00.330 --> 02:01.680
correctly.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.650
And I'm just going to zoom in just a little bit more here and this is going to take some playing around

02:07.650 --> 02:13.170
with so maybe I will select the circle and if you hold down shift in the up arrow key it will nudge

02:13.230 --> 02:17.630
this about 10 pixels each time that you hit the arrow key.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.010
So I've just nudged this up 20 pixels.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.980
I've got a nice shape here and now I'll draw a rectangle here.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.300
For the bottom area of the hat I'm going to move this around just a little bit.

02:31.570 --> 02:38.230
And now if I want I can click hold down shift and select these three circles which is going to group

02:38.230 --> 02:43.540
these for now so that when I hold down shift and select this rectangle I can align everything to the

02:43.540 --> 02:44.230
center.

02:44.380 --> 02:50.800
Make sure everything's aligned really good and I'll just hold down shift command g to ungroup everything

02:50.800 --> 02:53.080
now so we can see these shapes.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.450
We have three circles and one rectangle and that's making up our chef's hat.

02:57.820 --> 03:03.940
Now with this chef's hat I actually want the corners here to have a radius so I can do that by clicking

03:03.940 --> 03:04.840
on this radius.

03:04.860 --> 03:08.940
Anchor and change in that I think 7 pixels looks good.

03:10.550 --> 03:13.050
And we have the starting of our chefs hat already.

03:13.070 --> 03:19.310
So all we need to do at this point is select all of these shapes by holding down shift three simple

03:19.310 --> 03:27.500
shapes and we can come up here and we can see some settings for joining some shapes together for subtracting

03:27.500 --> 03:34.200
them and you can play around with these to create some nice combination effects for simple shapes.

03:34.220 --> 03:39.610
So I'm just going to use the union selection and now we have a one simple shape.

03:39.980 --> 03:47.010
I can change the fill color of this shape if I wanted or I could even remove the feel of this shape

03:47.100 --> 03:49.290
and add a stroke and the stroke.

03:49.290 --> 03:53.680
Let's make this white and let's say I want this to be 10 pixels.

03:54.570 --> 04:01.560
So we have this acting as one shape here but I can still double quick to drill down into this and you

04:01.560 --> 04:07.260
can see that it is actually behaving as four different shapes that are joined together so I can still

04:07.260 --> 04:12.480
tweak this a little bit and give it a little bit more personality if I wanted make these a tiny bit

04:12.480 --> 04:13.140
on even

04:16.110 --> 04:19.830
which is very handy to make some subtle changes there.

04:19.880 --> 04:26.400
The last thing I'm going to do for this shape so click in the shapes tool and create a line and I'm

04:26.400 --> 04:32.590
just going to click and drag holding down shift and I want to copy the same style so I'm going to write

04:32.590 --> 04:38.360
click here and copy style and I'll right click on this image.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.230
And paste this style.

04:42.820 --> 04:49.430
So we have a nice pasted style but I want the ends of this line to be rounded so I can jump into the

04:49.430 --> 04:55.290
advanced menu of The Strokes and decide that I want the cap to be rounded.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.750
I've got a nice rounded effect and now I'm just going to select this line.

05:00.950 --> 05:07.460
Hold down option and just drag down to get just one more line below that.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.940
And now I want to join all of this as one shape.

05:11.070 --> 05:15.170
So I'm going to hold down Shift while I'm selecting these two lines and this one shape.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.280
And now that I have these three selected I can hit command G.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.530
And that will all be grouped into one shape.

05:24.300 --> 05:28.320
Now please scroll down and move over into the home frame.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.550
There are a few other icons that we can recreate with basic shapes here as well.

05:32.790 --> 05:39.120
So I'll just zoom into the top area here for some navigation icons and we want to search icon here on

05:39.120 --> 05:41.430
the home page and also a menu icon.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.010
So the menu icon can be very simple.

05:44.130 --> 05:51.630
I can go back into the shapes tool and click on rectangle and here I'm just going to quickly draw a

05:51.630 --> 05:52.630
hamburger menu.

05:52.650 --> 05:58.550
So going to hold down option here and copy this leave in six pixels in between and we can see that this

05:58.550 --> 06:02.680
shape is 41 pixels by six pixels.

06:02.680 --> 06:09.150
Now I just make this an even 40 by selecting all of these rectangles and choosing 40 pixels in the design

06:09.150 --> 06:14.610
panel and then I want us to have a little bit more personality so I'm going to just decrease the size

06:14.610 --> 06:16.290
of these a little bit.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.450
To make their menu icon look a little bit staggered.

06:23.430 --> 06:30.000
And the last thing I want to do here is I actually want bees radiuses here on the right side to be curved.

06:30.370 --> 06:36.400
So zooming in here I want to do that and curve these edges what I can do is select all three of these

06:36.400 --> 06:42.010
rectangles and I can change the radius here if I change this to 3 pixels so you can see that everything

06:42.010 --> 06:43.440
changes to three pixels.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.500
But what if I want to individually change the pixel sizes on each corner.

06:47.620 --> 06:55.320
Well I'm going to undo this and here this gives me control to change the radius for each corner starting

06:55.320 --> 06:56.470
with the top left.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.440
So the top left we know we want to be zero and the top right.

07:00.450 --> 07:03.810
We want to be three pixels and the bottom right.

07:03.810 --> 07:10.940
We want to be three pixels and then we want the bottom left to stay zero pixels.

07:11.260 --> 07:17.350
So we have our hamburger menu here and we can group this as well by just selecting everything and choosing

07:17.350 --> 07:18.780
Union selection.

07:19.060 --> 07:27.770
And now we have this one icon here I can change all of it to be black red whatever color that I want

07:27.780 --> 07:30.430
here.

07:30.450 --> 07:35.520
So now we want to create a magnifying glass and we can do that by going into the shape's options here.

07:35.520 --> 07:42.490
I'm going to click on the elipse tool and holding down shift or just drag and draw an ellipse and we'll

07:42.490 --> 07:45.690
start out with 23 pixels I think that's good.

07:46.180 --> 07:52.360
And we can actually remove the fill here by selecting on the outside of this row clicking the subtract

07:52.420 --> 07:53.610
and then we'll add a stroke.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.600
And we want the stroke to be red.

07:56.110 --> 08:03.220
And I think inside the stroke is good we can align this to the outside of the middle or the inside we're

08:03.220 --> 08:04.640
going to keep it on the inside.

08:04.990 --> 08:09.010
And I'm going to have the stroke wait be two pixels here.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.270
Now I'm going to draw a rectangle.

08:12.260 --> 08:21.890
And now four pixels is good maybe four pixels by 10 or 12 and we can change this later if we want.

08:22.160 --> 08:27.740
And the feel of this brunette changed to be the same red color and I'm just going to slit both of these

08:27.770 --> 08:29.010
and align them.

08:29.420 --> 08:34.940
So we have two simple shapes here and you'll notice when I tried to align this this has 23 pixels but

08:34.940 --> 08:40.070
this has four pixels so we have an even with an odd with which is making it look a little bit staggered

08:40.400 --> 08:41.270
sort of change that.

08:41.270 --> 08:45.350
I'm just going to change the width of this to 20 pixels.

08:45.350 --> 08:49.170
So they're both even all do in a line again.

08:49.330 --> 08:52.070
And that's just nudge this up with our arrow keys.

08:54.370 --> 08:57.800
Now one thing that you can do with rectangles or circles or any other shape.

08:57.970 --> 09:04.000
If I zoom in here I can select this rectangle and if I hold down command with my arrow keys I can nudge

09:04.060 --> 09:10.720
up or down and it will decrease or increase the size whether that's the height or if I use the right

09:10.720 --> 09:12.030
or left arrows it's the width.

09:12.070 --> 09:17.200
So it's a very nice shortcut to nudge the sizes to get it precisely the way that you want.

09:17.470 --> 09:23.890
Now I'm going to add just a small radius here of one pixel around we have a nice rounded corners on

09:23.890 --> 09:29.860
this magnifying glass and the last thing we can do is select this fill in this stroke and choose union

09:29.860 --> 09:33.710
selection and actually combines this stroke with the fill which makes it quite nice.

09:33.850 --> 09:36.110
Now by double click inside of here.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.760
Hold down shift to select this circle.

09:38.890 --> 09:45.630
I'm just going to rotate the both of these at 45 degrees and hit return.

09:47.250 --> 09:52.920
And now we have this shape the shape shows twenty five point eight five pixels and we want it to be

09:52.920 --> 09:59.720
an even 40 pixels so I can click here to constrain the proportions and choose this to be 40 pixels.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.690
And now if I hold down command and zoom out with my scroll will you can see that that's proportionally

10:06.690 --> 10:12.420
the same width as this hamburger menu.

10:13.960 --> 10:22.240
So I'm going to bring this over here and we have a nice starting out of a hamburger menu and a magnifying

10:22.240 --> 10:25.240
glass menu with some basic simple shapes.

10:26.210 --> 10:31.610
Now in the same home page we can tap our for rectangle and if I hold down the ship I can strain the

10:31.610 --> 10:33.070
size of this.

10:33.090 --> 10:37.570
We want this rectangle to be 2:21 by 2:21 So we'll just match it with the columns here.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.640
And this is going to be where image is going to live.

10:39.650 --> 10:43.920
But to the top right of this image we're going to have a heart icon.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.850
So I'm going to just zoom in here and to draw a heart.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.880
I'm going to click and drag a.

10:50.930 --> 10:54.590
I'll start out with 10 pixel by 15 pixel here.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.500
And I'll make this white so you can see it.

10:58.580 --> 11:02.900
And the first thing we can do is change the radius of this heart is going to be one side of the heart

11:02.930 --> 11:03.350
here.

11:03.500 --> 11:08.780
So the top left is going to be five pixels the top right is going to be five pixels.

11:09.020 --> 11:15.210
And then these two at the bottom are going to be zero pixels now I can hold down option and copy the

11:15.210 --> 11:19.710
shape I'm going to rotate this 90 degrees holding down shift.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.950
Not going to line this here.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.050
You can see we have a nice heart.

11:24.210 --> 11:26.210
So now I will select both of these shapes.

11:26.550 --> 11:29.670
Rotate this forty five degrees for our heart shape.

11:30.450 --> 11:34.840
And the last thing we want to do is hit this Join button and now we have a heart icon.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.560
And I want to change the feel of this to be removed.

11:38.690 --> 11:42.680
I'm going to add a stroke and this will be a white stroke.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.680
And let's try to pixels here.

11:45.680 --> 11:51.560
Now if I hold down command and zoom out you can see what that looks like and how this sits in relation

11:51.560 --> 11:56.940
to this image that we're going to have so I can set this to that top right here.

11:57.260 --> 12:03.980
And then instead of using my x and y values here to nudge this around I can hold down shift and just

12:03.980 --> 12:11.960
nudge this left 10 pixels and down 10 pixels and it's sitting nicely now inside of this image.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.640
If you ever want to see the sizing or the relationship of sizing between two devices you can select

12:17.000 --> 12:22.940
this heart for example and then just hold down option and you'll get these nice red indicators of how

12:22.940 --> 12:28.880
many pixels are between the edges of certain elements and you can see here because the shape is on some

12:28.880 --> 12:29.640
pixels.

12:29.790 --> 12:35.060
This notched nine point nine three pixels if you want to change that to be an even width you can lock

12:35.090 --> 12:36.290
proportions here.

12:36.430 --> 12:40.390
And let's just change this to maybe be 20 pixels wide.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.870
You can change that.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.160
And now let's try this again solemnised at the top right.

12:45.170 --> 12:48.900
Hold down shift and left and down arrow.

12:49.010 --> 12:54.470
Now one last thing you might notice when we increase the size here that doesn't increase the radius.

12:54.740 --> 13:02.420
What we should have done if we undo this a little bit is go to the scale tool and now using the scale

13:02.420 --> 13:08.630
tool you can scale this up and down and the radius will also scale with it the way that we did it before

13:08.630 --> 13:13.020
is to actually use the Move tool and tried scaling this which resizes.

13:13.140 --> 13:20.590
But you can see those radiuses still stay about five pixels if you ever did accidently resize it this

13:20.590 --> 13:21.480
way.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.040
And we can see that those radiuses haven't scaled.

13:26.050 --> 13:28.190
You can always double click inside of here.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.420
Hold down shift and then just make a quick change maybe.

13:31.450 --> 13:35.180
So these 10 pixels now and you can see a nice rounded radius.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.760
So it's really nice to show you how to troubleshoot these things too because it'll always come up as

13:39.760 --> 13:45.040
your scale on things you might wonder why the radiuses or the strokes aren't looking good.

13:45.040 --> 13:50.860
So there's a big difference between just resizing and using that scale tool.

13:50.860 --> 13:54.760
So now we know we want a five star rating system for our recipe.

13:55.030 --> 13:59.520
And under the shape's options we have the star tool that's really handy.

13:59.620 --> 14:06.220
So I'm going to just click and drag and hold down shift to lock my ratio and I can drag this any size

14:06.220 --> 14:06.870
that I want.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.450
And later I can come in here lock my proportions.

14:10.570 --> 14:18.390
I'm just going to make the 16 pixels wide here and let's zoom in so I can either keep this style that

14:18.390 --> 14:19.060
is given me.

14:19.080 --> 14:24.600
But I have a few controls to change the style to how I want this to look.

14:24.600 --> 14:31.140
And one of those is changing the counts here I can change this to three four five or 30 count and I

14:31.140 --> 14:35.160
can also change the ratios to if I want to give these points a little bit more bolder I can do that

14:35.160 --> 14:42.930
with this ratio anchor and that I have a radius control and I'll just zoom in here a little bit to show

14:42.930 --> 14:44.960
you how this radius control works.

14:44.970 --> 14:51.720
So if I push this down you can see I have an option for one or two pixel radius and so that seems like

14:51.720 --> 14:52.450
a bit much.

14:52.440 --> 14:57.990
So if you want something that's more subtle than that you can still go into this design panel and I'll

14:57.990 --> 15:04.380
just type Point 2 ratio just for a nice soft point here unless the I want to change this field to be

15:04.380 --> 15:11.250
a little bit lighter because this is the background to the star and I'm going to zoom out and holding

15:11.250 --> 15:12.500
down option.

15:12.660 --> 15:16.450
I'll just copy this four times.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.180
And we know with this particular recipe is going to be four and a half stars so I'm going to select

15:24.180 --> 15:26.520
four of these stars make them red.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.880
But how do we get half of this star to be red.

15:29.100 --> 15:35.260
Well if you hold down option and copy this we've seen that we can combine shapes but we can also subtract

15:35.260 --> 15:35.800
shapes.

15:35.830 --> 15:40.410
So we have this star and we want to subtract a rectangle from the star.

15:40.450 --> 15:46.600
So I'm just going to drag a rectangle here we're going to snap it to the very center of this star and

15:46.600 --> 15:50.550
I'm going to turn down the opacity here just to show you what's happening.

15:50.620 --> 15:55.080
So we have this rectangle that's overlain this star.

15:55.390 --> 16:01.140
And so now when I select these two simple shapes I can go in here and I can still use this union selection.

16:01.150 --> 16:04.430
But that just gives me one really weird shape.

16:05.820 --> 16:12.030
Or I can click in this down arrow and you subtract selection to subtract the rectangle from the star

16:12.030 --> 16:14.130
which gives me a nice half star.

16:14.310 --> 16:18.760
If you'd like to see what the other options do you can play around with that by just clicking undo.

16:19.110 --> 16:24.660
And we'll go and use exclude selection which will exclude anything that's intersecting between the two

16:24.660 --> 16:25.670
selections.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.240
And we also have intersect.

16:29.330 --> 16:33.150
So anything that's the intersecting it will give us that right half of the star.

16:33.470 --> 16:38.330
So there's multiple ways that we can join or subtract shapes together.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.610
I'm just going to stick with this subtract selection here.

16:42.510 --> 16:52.550
And now I want to copy this style and paste the style on this star and we see very easily we have this

16:52.550 --> 16:54.700
nice four and a half stars.

16:54.710 --> 17:00.320
Now you can see here the star isn't quite a line and that's because instead of being a nice even 16

17:00.320 --> 17:03.050
by 16 pixels now will be cut it in half.

17:03.050 --> 17:08.840
It has a 7.3 by thirteen point eighty five pixels in here.

17:08.840 --> 17:14.180
So if we want to align this we can still get past this by double clicking inside of here and we'll just

17:14.180 --> 17:17.880
select both of these shapes inside of this join.

17:18.200 --> 17:23.240
And once we click both of the shapes we can snap this to align with other shapes.

17:23.240 --> 17:27.320
It's just a weird quirk but learning how to get past things like this will really help you save time

17:27.320 --> 17:28.940
and align things.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.440
Now zoom out here to see the finished result.

17:31.730 --> 17:36.320
And we can select all of these shapes and use command g to group all of them and just make sure they're

17:36.320 --> 17:38.620
centered here on the frame.

17:39.860 --> 17:45.140
Now these are just a few ways that we can use shapes you see that we created a nice icon here hamburger

17:45.140 --> 17:53.300
menu search icon and this hurt here learning how to use the shapes tools and also the bully on tools

17:53.300 --> 17:54.390
that we see here.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.770
Give you a lot of power in creating the icons that you'd like.
