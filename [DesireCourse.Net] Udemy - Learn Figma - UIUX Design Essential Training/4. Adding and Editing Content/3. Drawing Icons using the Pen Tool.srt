1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,460
If you're following along from the previous video Feel free to use the same file as we continue designing.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,570
If you're just starting with this video you can open up the drawing icons using the pen tool thick file.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,750
So now we're going to show you how to create icons using the pen tool and we'll do this under the recipe

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,640
details frame.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,040
So before we do that I'm just going to hold down option and copy some of these items here and this heart.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,740
We're also going to reuse this over here on the top right.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,010
So I'm going to nudge this over.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,500
Make it 10 pixels.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,520
By 10 pixels by using the arrow key and shift to nudge this over.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,640
So we have a nice starting and now there are two icons down below here that we want to create.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,000
So I'm going to zoom into this area and if I click on this recipe details frame I'm going to just hide

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,100
this layout grid for now as we design these icons.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,000
So these icons that we create are going to live inside of a circle and these circles are each going

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,280
to be 36 pixels.

15
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,610
So we'll just create a 36 pixel circle.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,300
We'll fill this with red.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,800
And let's zoom in and let's create our first icon inside of here so we can use this pen tool and this

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,400
pen tool we can just click certain areas to create straight lines and if we want to close the shape

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,160
we just click on this last note here and I'll close the shape for us.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,280
So it's very simple to create straight shaped objects.

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,890
And if I hit escape it will get me out of edit mode and I can delete this.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,360
But there are also times where we want to click and drag to create a curve.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,760
So I'll show you how this works here.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,870
That's create a shopping bag.

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,920
We'll do that by clicking the pen tool.

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,470
And I'm just going to click and drag certain areas here

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:10,450
and we have a bag shape and I can click on this anchor here and just nudge this to make things even

28
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,340
click this one and that looks good.

29
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:25,420
So now that I've done that I also want to create a handle here so I can click and here I'll just click

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,210
and drag and it'll introduce us to some drag handles here.

31
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,150
You can see here this drag handle is pushing this curve to the left.

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,910
This is pushing out to the right.

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,560
And now I can click in and this and if we ever want to change that we can use this select tool right

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
here select this note.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,930
You can see these drag handles and we can move these and change each one.

36
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,010
You can see how these are locked with the left and right handle.

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,930
If I hold down option it'll break that length here so that I can drag this independently of the other

38
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,150
one

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,520
so we can easily move these drag handles around and get the shape exactly how we want it.

40
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,840
And once we're done using the pen tool we've created a nice shopping bag I can now because I use strokes

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,930
using the pen tool if I decided to add a field to this it wouldn't look very good because you don't

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,990
want the field to be where the handle area is.

43
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,480
So I'm going to hit command Z or controls the on the windows and I can still double click inside of

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:46,770
here and using this paint bucket tool I can decide I want this area to be filled and not this area.

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:55,280
So now that area is filled I'm going to make this film Black and I will hit done here and we have our

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,380
shopping bag.

47
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,470
Last thing we need to do is put it inside of the circle and it looks a little bit too big inside of

48
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,940
the circle someone going to constrain the proportions.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,400
And I'll just make this 16 pixels here.

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,290
And that looks like a nice size.

51
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,880
And now I want to make everything white so I'm going to change this field to be white.

52
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,640
I'll change the stroke to be white.

53
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,470
And the last thing I want to do is double click instead of here.

54
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,630
I can still select these notes that I used in the pen tool a hold down shift to select just the four

55
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,830
corners here and I'm going to add just a one pixel radius to make those corners curved inside of there.

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,530
Now if we hold down option and we copy this circle there's one more icon we're going to create with

57
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,520
the pen tool.

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,380
And that's the chef's icon has the same icon that we created on the splash screen.

59
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,780
But I just want to show you how to create this using the pen tool.

60
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,630
So I like to create it outside of this box.

61
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,700
First of all we can fit it in later.

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,840
So I'm just going to create the bottom of the hat here.

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,230
Do something like this.

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,400
And then we can just play around with these kind of Bolger's on the chef's hat.

65
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,960
And right here you can see that I have a left drag handle on a right drag handle so if I let go and

66
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,150
I want a shape to come around here now I actually can't do that unless I hold down option and select

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,550
this to break the symmetry between these drag handles so I can say I want this curve to start out here

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,750
and you can see it's giving me a little preview of what's that's going to look like.

69
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,780
So here I can say I'll start here.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:39,850
And let's just click and drag will hold down option to break that symmetry again and let's click and

71
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,710
drag somewhere here and here.

72
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,470
So you can see this is looking a little bit funky but that's one really nice feature with this pen tool

73
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,940
as we can click on this new tool inside of our edit mode and very easily we can just adjust these and

74
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,940
make the curves really nice and maybe this.

75
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,990
We want to move over here.

76
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,210
And so within just a few seconds we can kind of clean up those curves here

77
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,500
and it really doesn't matter if it has a huge amount of symmetry because this looks more organic if

78
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,030
you just played around with different shapes here.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Move this down here.

80
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,330
Bring this down starting to look pretty good.

81
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,690
This looks a little bit flat will decrease these a little bit.

82
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:42,590
And then we want to select just these two notes at the bottom at a two pixel radius bring the same

83
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,340
something like that looks decent.

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,600
So we have our chef's hat and by double click on this again to jump into edit mode.

85
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm just going to use the pen tool to create two more lines here could escape to and that and one more

86
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,430
right here and again hit escape will double click to end it.

87
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,270
And we also want to jump into the advanced menus and cap this as rounded for these edges here and we

88
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:28,710
can now resize this to whatever size that we want and fit this side up here will make the stroke quite.

89
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,420
And now if you want to double click inside of this to go into attack mode again the last thing we want

90
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,840
to do is use this paint bucket tool to feel the inside of this with the color white.

91
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,540
So now zooming out we have a shopping icon and a preparation icon so as movies down here.
