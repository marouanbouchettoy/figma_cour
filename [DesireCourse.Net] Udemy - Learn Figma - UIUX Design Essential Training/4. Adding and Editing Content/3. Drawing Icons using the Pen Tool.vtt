00:00.300 --> 00:05.460
If you're following along from the previous video Feel free to use the same file as we continue designing.

00:05.580 --> 00:11.570
If you're just starting with this video you can open up the drawing icons using the pen tool thick file.

00:11.610 --> 00:15.750
So now we're going to show you how to create icons using the pen tool and we'll do this under the recipe

00:15.750 --> 00:17.640
details frame.

00:17.640 --> 00:26.040
So before we do that I'm just going to hold down option and copy some of these items here and this heart.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.740
We're also going to reuse this over here on the top right.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.010
So I'm going to nudge this over.

00:32.010 --> 00:33.500
Make it 10 pixels.

00:35.940 --> 00:40.520
By 10 pixels by using the arrow key and shift to nudge this over.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.640
So we have a nice starting and now there are two icons down below here that we want to create.

00:46.680 --> 00:54.000
So I'm going to zoom into this area and if I click on this recipe details frame I'm going to just hide

00:54.000 --> 00:58.100
this layout grid for now as we design these icons.

00:58.170 --> 01:03.000
So these icons that we create are going to live inside of a circle and these circles are each going

01:03.000 --> 01:06.280
to be 36 pixels.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.610
So we'll just create a 36 pixel circle.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.300
We'll fill this with red.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.800
And let's zoom in and let's create our first icon inside of here so we can use this pen tool and this

01:16.800 --> 01:23.400
pen tool we can just click certain areas to create straight lines and if we want to close the shape

01:23.430 --> 01:28.160
we just click on this last note here and I'll close the shape for us.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.280
So it's very simple to create straight shaped objects.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.890
And if I hit escape it will get me out of edit mode and I can delete this.

01:37.110 --> 01:44.360
But there are also times where we want to click and drag to create a curve.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.760
So I'll show you how this works here.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.870
That's create a shopping bag.

01:50.070 --> 01:51.920
We'll do that by clicking the pen tool.

01:52.050 --> 01:57.470
And I'm just going to click and drag certain areas here

02:02.530 --> 02:10.450
and we have a bag shape and I can click on this anchor here and just nudge this to make things even

02:10.990 --> 02:15.340
click this one and that looks good.

02:16.750 --> 02:25.420
So now that I've done that I also want to create a handle here so I can click and here I'll just click

02:25.420 --> 02:29.210
and drag and it'll introduce us to some drag handles here.

02:29.260 --> 02:33.150
You can see here this drag handle is pushing this curve to the left.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.910
This is pushing out to the right.

02:35.180 --> 02:42.560
And now I can click in and this and if we ever want to change that we can use this select tool right

02:42.560 --> 02:44.160
here select this note.

02:44.180 --> 02:48.930
You can see these drag handles and we can move these and change each one.

02:49.070 --> 02:53.010
You can see how these are locked with the left and right handle.

02:53.120 --> 02:59.930
If I hold down option it'll break that length here so that I can drag this independently of the other

02:59.930 --> 03:00.150
one

03:06.560 --> 03:13.520
so we can easily move these drag handles around and get the shape exactly how we want it.

03:16.550 --> 03:23.840
And once we're done using the pen tool we've created a nice shopping bag I can now because I use strokes

03:23.840 --> 03:29.930
using the pen tool if I decided to add a field to this it wouldn't look very good because you don't

03:29.930 --> 03:32.990
want the field to be where the handle area is.

03:32.990 --> 03:38.480
So I'm going to hit command Z or controls the on the windows and I can still double click inside of

03:38.480 --> 03:46.770
here and using this paint bucket tool I can decide I want this area to be filled and not this area.

03:46.940 --> 03:55.280
So now that area is filled I'm going to make this film Black and I will hit done here and we have our

03:55.280 --> 03:56.380
shopping bag.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.470
Last thing we need to do is put it inside of the circle and it looks a little bit too big inside of

04:00.470 --> 04:03.940
the circle someone going to constrain the proportions.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.400
And I'll just make this 16 pixels here.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.290
And that looks like a nice size.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.880
And now I want to make everything white so I'm going to change this field to be white.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.640
I'll change the stroke to be white.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.470
And the last thing I want to do is double click instead of here.

04:17.470 --> 04:22.630
I can still select these notes that I used in the pen tool a hold down shift to select just the four

04:22.630 --> 04:29.830
corners here and I'm going to add just a one pixel radius to make those corners curved inside of there.

04:29.830 --> 04:35.530
Now if we hold down option and we copy this circle there's one more icon we're going to create with

04:35.530 --> 04:36.520
the pen tool.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.380
And that's the chef's icon has the same icon that we created on the splash screen.

04:40.390 --> 04:43.780
But I just want to show you how to create this using the pen tool.

04:44.170 --> 04:46.630
So I like to create it outside of this box.

04:46.630 --> 04:48.700
First of all we can fit it in later.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.840
So I'm just going to create the bottom of the hat here.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.230
Do something like this.

04:54.480 --> 05:00.400
And then we can just play around with these kind of Bolger's on the chef's hat.

05:01.590 --> 05:06.960
And right here you can see that I have a left drag handle on a right drag handle so if I let go and

05:06.960 --> 05:16.150
I want a shape to come around here now I actually can't do that unless I hold down option and select

05:16.200 --> 05:23.550
this to break the symmetry between these drag handles so I can say I want this curve to start out here

05:23.900 --> 05:27.750
and you can see it's giving me a little preview of what's that's going to look like.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.780
So here I can say I'll start here.

05:30.780 --> 05:39.850
And let's just click and drag will hold down option to break that symmetry again and let's click and

05:39.850 --> 05:44.710
drag somewhere here and here.

05:44.710 --> 05:50.470
So you can see this is looking a little bit funky but that's one really nice feature with this pen tool

05:50.770 --> 05:57.940
as we can click on this new tool inside of our edit mode and very easily we can just adjust these and

05:57.940 --> 06:01.940
make the curves really nice and maybe this.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.990
We want to move over here.

06:04.930 --> 06:09.210
And so within just a few seconds we can kind of clean up those curves here

06:12.060 --> 06:17.500
and it really doesn't matter if it has a huge amount of symmetry because this looks more organic if

06:18.190 --> 06:21.030
you just played around with different shapes here.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.960
Move this down here.

06:25.540 --> 06:29.330
Bring this down starting to look pretty good.

06:29.330 --> 06:33.690
This looks a little bit flat will decrease these a little bit.

06:35.020 --> 06:42.590
And then we want to select just these two notes at the bottom at a two pixel radius bring the same

06:48.490 --> 06:50.340
something like that looks decent.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.600
So we have our chef's hat and by double click on this again to jump into edit mode.

06:56.770 --> 07:03.820
I'm just going to use the pen tool to create two more lines here could escape to and that and one more

07:03.820 --> 07:08.430
right here and again hit escape will double click to end it.

07:09.250 --> 07:16.270
And we also want to jump into the advanced menus and cap this as rounded for these edges here and we

07:16.270 --> 07:28.710
can now resize this to whatever size that we want and fit this side up here will make the stroke quite.

07:28.770 --> 07:33.420
And now if you want to double click inside of this to go into attack mode again the last thing we want

07:33.420 --> 07:39.840
to do is use this paint bucket tool to feel the inside of this with the color white.

07:40.710 --> 07:47.540
So now zooming out we have a shopping icon and a preparation icon so as movies down here.
