1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,390
If you want to design more freeform shapes you can use the pencil tool and you can find this tool here

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,040
under this drop down arrow next to the pen tool.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,210
You'll find this pencil tool.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,420
I'm just going to hold down Z and draw a rectangle here to just zoom into this area.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,490
So if you do have a Wakem tablet or something.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,110
I'm just using my mouse right now.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,080
So this text might be a little bit choppy but you can kind of see how the pencil tool works here.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,940
If we just

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,220
create some freeform cursive for each

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,570
and the nice thing about this is although the text is quite choppy you can still jump into the move

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:54,920
tool in here and double click on the shape you have access to all of these nodes so I can select all

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,000
of these for example and use this Bantul and it will try to help it become a little bit more curvy or

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,450
I can select some of these notes here go under the vector menu and delete and he'll selection and it

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,800
will make that a lot more curvy.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,310
I'm going to do the same thing over here.

16
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:19,840
Vector Dilley and hill so you can see how much cleaner your shapes can be if you just spend a little

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
bit of time after you start out a little bit rough.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,460
So like this one for example Lee Hill just makes that nice and curvy.

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,150
Same thing here to Lee Hill

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,480
and then from here you can still change things around.

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,540
So it's a very nice combination to use that.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,740
Now if you want to use the pencil tool for tracing as well then you can import images into your thick

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,980
file and then use the pencil tool to closely trace certain shapes.

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,340
Now because I was using my mouse this wasn't a great example of how to use the pencil tool there is

25
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,490
something that I love using with this pencil tool.

26
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,330
When I'm on my Mac and that is the app called Astro pad and my iPad.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,070
So using my iPad I can use of the same way as a Wakem tablet or if you have a Wakem tablet with a pencil

28
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,240
you can do the same kind of thing and you have more control over the look of this pencil shape.

29
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,330
So here very easily I can just start creating some letters

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,170
and easily here and do things don't make it the first round.

31
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,970
And here you can see that this first pass looks a lot cleaner.

32
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:01,090
So you can still use those vector menus to heal selections to smooth joints some selections and to clean

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,140
this up even further.

34
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,500
But from here I can easily choose the shapes and align them the way that I want.

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,720
Resize them the way that I want and get this look exactly how I want it.

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,010
Last thing I'm going to do here is change the stroke to white.

37
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,340
And let's just add a three pixel feel here and just a line this little bit better

38
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,490
something like that will work good.

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:39,030
And if you don't want all of these layers here to mess up your layers panel just hit command G and everything

40
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,370
will be selected here.

41
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,930
Now we have a nice handmade font.
