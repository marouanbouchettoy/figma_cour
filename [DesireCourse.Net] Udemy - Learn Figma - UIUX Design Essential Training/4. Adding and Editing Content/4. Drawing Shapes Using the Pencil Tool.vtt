If you want to design more freeform shapes you can use the pencil tool and you can find this tool here

00:06.390 --> 00:09.040
under this drop down arrow next to the pen tool.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.210
You'll find this pencil tool.

00:11.250 --> 00:16.420
I'm just going to hold down Z and draw a rectangle here to just zoom into this area.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.490
So if you do have a Wakem tablet or something.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.110
I'm just using my mouse right now.

00:22.150 --> 00:27.080
So this text might be a little bit choppy but you can kind of see how the pencil tool works here.

00:27.160 --> 00:27.940
If we just

00:30.890 --> 00:34.220
create some freeform cursive for each

00:40.280 --> 00:47.570
and the nice thing about this is although the text is quite choppy you can still jump into the move

00:47.570 --> 00:54.920
tool in here and double click on the shape you have access to all of these nodes so I can select all

00:54.920 --> 01:02.000
of these for example and use this Bantul and it will try to help it become a little bit more curvy or

01:02.000 --> 01:08.450
I can select some of these notes here go under the vector menu and delete and he'll selection and it

01:08.450 --> 01:10.800
will make that a lot more curvy.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.310
I'm going to do the same thing over here.

01:12.350 --> 01:19.840
Vector Dilley and hill so you can see how much cleaner your shapes can be if you just spend a little

01:19.840 --> 01:24.640
bit of time after you start out a little bit rough.

01:24.700 --> 01:30.460
So like this one for example Lee Hill just makes that nice and curvy.

01:30.460 --> 01:34.150
Same thing here to Lee Hill

01:42.150 --> 01:47.480
and then from here you can still change things around.

01:48.090 --> 01:51.540
So it's a very nice combination to use that.

01:51.590 --> 01:56.740
Now if you want to use the pencil tool for tracing as well then you can import images into your thick

01:56.850 --> 02:01.980
file and then use the pencil tool to closely trace certain shapes.

02:01.980 --> 02:08.340
Now because I was using my mouse this wasn't a great example of how to use the pencil tool there is

02:08.340 --> 02:11.490
something that I love using with this pencil tool.

02:11.490 --> 02:16.330
When I'm on my Mac and that is the app called Astro pad and my iPad.

02:16.560 --> 02:23.070
So using my iPad I can use of the same way as a Wakem tablet or if you have a Wakem tablet with a pencil

02:23.340 --> 02:30.240
you can do the same kind of thing and you have more control over the look of this pencil shape.

02:30.270 --> 02:33.330
So here very easily I can just start creating some letters

02:35.880 --> 02:41.170
and easily here and do things don't make it the first round.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.970
And here you can see that this first pass looks a lot cleaner.

02:54.010 --> 03:01.090
So you can still use those vector menus to heal selections to smooth joints some selections and to clean

03:01.090 --> 03:03.140
this up even further.

03:03.490 --> 03:08.500
But from here I can easily choose the shapes and align them the way that I want.

03:08.500 --> 03:13.720
Resize them the way that I want and get this look exactly how I want it.

03:13.750 --> 03:18.010
Last thing I'm going to do here is change the stroke to white.

03:18.010 --> 03:23.340
And let's just add a three pixel feel here and just a line this little bit better

03:27.450 --> 03:29.490
something like that will work good.

03:30.150 --> 03:39.030
And if you don't want all of these layers here to mess up your layers panel just hit command G and everything

03:39.030 --> 03:40.370
will be selected here.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.930
Now we have a nice handmade font.
