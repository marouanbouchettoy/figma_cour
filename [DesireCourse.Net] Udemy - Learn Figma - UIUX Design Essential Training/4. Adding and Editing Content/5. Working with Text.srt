1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,850
To show you how text and the text properties work are going to be adding some text into the recipe details

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,600
frame that we created in a previous video.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,260
If you haven't followed along and just jumped into this video then you can find this file under the

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,460
Chapter 4 folder in your exercise files.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,820
So to save time typing up some text I have a recipe prime rib text file you can find in the assets folder.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,250
And here let's just open this up and we can just refer to this as we crank along here.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,680
So the first thing we want to do is copy this text prime rib roast and that's just click on this tee

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,090
tool here.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm just going to click in a general area and paste this in prime rib roast.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,610
Now we can jump back into our text edit folder that's copy the summary text here command see or control

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:59,830
see on Windows and next time we use the tiki we're going to click and drag for a certain box that we

12
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,870
want to surround this text with.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,160
And I can hit command V here and paste this text inside of here.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,390
And we can already see that this page is going to be quite a bit longer than the others.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,150
So I'm going to drag this down here and next up pull this down.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,210
I can copy some of this text by holding down an option.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,020
I'm just going to copy this down here.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,530
Copy this down here and this.

19
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm just going to call this shopping list.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,510
And I have this in all caps and here I'm going just going to put this lower case preparation.

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,610
I'm going to show you why I do that later.

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,330
Next let's copy this over holding down an option we can drag and let's jump back into our text file

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:52,930
here and I'll copy this paste it in here.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,500
Hold down option

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:09,040
and copy this and paste it in so you can really type in anything that you want here.

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,890
This is just some sample text to help you understand how the text properties works.

27
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,290
So we have some one liner text here that's pretty simple if we click in here if we want to make this

28
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,080
bold For example we can choose bold.

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,880
We can change the size to say 18 pixels here.

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:35,250
And we can change the center justification here very easily and just Center this with this icon here.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,340
Now I can already see I want this text to be the same as this one.

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,210
So what I can do here is I can right click and copy this style and paste the style directly into here

33
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,570
and I have the same center justification eighteen point bold.

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,580
Here I can center that as well.

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,850
And now what do we do about these ingredients and the preparation.

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,640
Well the first thing I want to do is just change this maybe fourteen point here and you can see this

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,560
text is going beyond this bounding box here.

38
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,310
So I can click and drag this to surround this or I can click on this advanced menu and choose to auto

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,670
resize the height based off of the contents in there.

40
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,780
So now if I jump in here and I continue typing that bounding box is going to resize the next thing I

41
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,370
can do here is add a paragraph or line spacing.

42
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,660
So this is your regular line high.

43
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,360
And this is your paragraph spacings so I want to play with this little bit I'm just going to add 10

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,950
here.

45
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,110
So I really like how this is turning out here I can do the same thing in copy style and paste style

46
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,930
here and that's looking really good.

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,690
But notice here we already have some paragraphs here that were entered in the text so we can go through

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,640
and delete this to keep it accurate as far as the spacing goes.

49
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,920
And here we have the same problem with the bounding box so we can go into the advanced menu where you

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,460
can resize the height here and it looks like we need to resize our frame to be higher as well so I'm

51
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,860
going to hold down command.

52
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,980
Zoom out.

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,850
And I can resize that.

54
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,140
Let's just zoom back in here make sure our looks good.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,700
I actually want to increase the line height here to be maybe 110 percent.

56
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,850
Just to give a tiny bit more spacing.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,410
Now I can select these different elements and just position them

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,400
got 20 pixels here.

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,570
I'll probably put maybe 50 pixels one two three four five 50 pixels in between these two.

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,540
And same thing here.

61
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,640
One two three four or five and we've got 50 pixels so we already added some text.

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,970
Got a really nice sizing here.

63
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm just going to use Option Command C as a shortcut to copy the style An Option Command V to paste

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,830
this in the prime rib roast.

65
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,710
So we've got that styling down here and now I want to show you why I didn't capitalize this but I did

66
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,190
capitalize this so if you type things in caps it's hard to have control over changing the capitalization

67
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,630
later.

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,300
But if you have this all lowercase here I can quickly go into a bunch of text in my design file and

69
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,780
I can go and choose to transform this text to all uppercase here.

70
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,960
So you have a lot more flexibility and what that font is going to look like is you design further out.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,040
And lastly I'm going to copy the style here and paste it right here.

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,100
And I think that's looking really good.

73
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,720
Now I've already formatted all this text and rather than use the copy style paste style a bunch of times

74
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:54,220
I might find out that later I want this text to not be completely black but I want it to be a little

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
bit lighter.

76
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,820
So rather than clicking and trying to select everything in our art board we can click on one of these

77
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,330
go under Edit and we can choose to select everything with the same style here so selecting all of these

78
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:16,240
three and I can quickly go in here and say now the style I want the text to be just a tiny bit lighter.

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,310
So something like this and you can see that it changed that for these two.

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,570
But this right here has something different.

81
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,110
There's something different in the style and that's the line spacing here.

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,120
So Option Command see Option Command B and we have that same type of styling.

83
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:40,680
What's really great though is you don't have to rely on one style for this entire text box field.

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:48,320
So for example as far as the amount of ingredients that we have here I want this to be bold and I want

85
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,390
that to be totally black.

86
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:58,090
So once I change that you can definitely see the difference between the amount and the actual ingredient.

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,460
So I can do the same thing here.

88
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,700
This black and bold

89
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,540
and we can change that independent of the other characters in this bounding box.
