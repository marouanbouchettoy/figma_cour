00:00.420 --> 00:05.850
To show you how text and the text properties work are going to be adding some text into the recipe details

00:05.850 --> 00:08.600
frame that we created in a previous video.

00:09.550 --> 00:14.260
If you haven't followed along and just jumped into this video then you can find this file under the

00:14.260 --> 00:17.460
Chapter 4 folder in your exercise files.

00:17.550 --> 00:25.820
So to save time typing up some text I have a recipe prime rib text file you can find in the assets folder.

00:26.080 --> 00:32.250
And here let's just open this up and we can just refer to this as we crank along here.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.680
So the first thing we want to do is copy this text prime rib roast and that's just click on this tee

00:39.010 --> 00:40.090
tool here.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.640
I'm just going to click in a general area and paste this in prime rib roast.

00:44.660 --> 00:51.610
Now we can jump back into our text edit folder that's copy the summary text here command see or control

00:51.610 --> 00:59.830
see on Windows and next time we use the tiki we're going to click and drag for a certain box that we

00:59.830 --> 01:01.870
want to surround this text with.

01:02.140 --> 01:06.160
And I can hit command V here and paste this text inside of here.

01:07.300 --> 01:12.390
And we can already see that this page is going to be quite a bit longer than the others.

01:12.520 --> 01:18.150
So I'm going to drag this down here and next up pull this down.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.210
I can copy some of this text by holding down an option.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.020
I'm just going to copy this down here.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.530
Copy this down here and this.

01:25.530 --> 01:29.200
I'm just going to call this shopping list.

01:29.520 --> 01:36.510
And I have this in all caps and here I'm going just going to put this lower case preparation.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.610
I'm going to show you why I do that later.

01:40.110 --> 01:45.330
Next let's copy this over holding down an option we can drag and let's jump back into our text file

01:45.330 --> 01:52.930
here and I'll copy this paste it in here.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.500
Hold down option

01:58.750 --> 02:09.040
and copy this and paste it in so you can really type in anything that you want here.

02:09.100 --> 02:14.890
This is just some sample text to help you understand how the text properties works.

02:15.430 --> 02:20.290
So we have some one liner text here that's pretty simple if we click in here if we want to make this

02:20.290 --> 02:23.080
bold For example we can choose bold.

02:23.380 --> 02:26.880
We can change the size to say 18 pixels here.

02:27.730 --> 02:35.250
And we can change the center justification here very easily and just Center this with this icon here.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.340
Now I can already see I want this text to be the same as this one.

02:39.340 --> 02:47.210
So what I can do here is I can right click and copy this style and paste the style directly into here

02:48.070 --> 02:52.570
and I have the same center justification eighteen point bold.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.580
Here I can center that as well.

02:56.320 --> 03:01.850
And now what do we do about these ingredients and the preparation.

03:02.170 --> 03:06.640
Well the first thing I want to do is just change this maybe fourteen point here and you can see this

03:06.640 --> 03:09.560
text is going beyond this bounding box here.

03:09.790 --> 03:15.310
So I can click and drag this to surround this or I can click on this advanced menu and choose to auto

03:15.310 --> 03:18.670
resize the height based off of the contents in there.

03:18.670 --> 03:25.780
So now if I jump in here and I continue typing that bounding box is going to resize the next thing I

03:25.780 --> 03:30.370
can do here is add a paragraph or line spacing.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.660
So this is your regular line high.

03:32.830 --> 03:37.360
And this is your paragraph spacings so I want to play with this little bit I'm just going to add 10

03:37.360 --> 03:37.950
here.

03:38.230 --> 03:44.110
So I really like how this is turning out here I can do the same thing in copy style and paste style

03:44.110 --> 03:46.930
here and that's looking really good.

03:47.080 --> 03:52.690
But notice here we already have some paragraphs here that were entered in the text so we can go through

03:52.690 --> 03:57.640
and delete this to keep it accurate as far as the spacing goes.

03:59.390 --> 04:03.920
And here we have the same problem with the bounding box so we can go into the advanced menu where you

04:03.920 --> 04:10.460
can resize the height here and it looks like we need to resize our frame to be higher as well so I'm

04:10.460 --> 04:11.860
going to hold down command.

04:12.020 --> 04:12.980
Zoom out.

04:14.660 --> 04:15.850
And I can resize that.

04:15.890 --> 04:19.140
Let's just zoom back in here make sure our looks good.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.700
I actually want to increase the line height here to be maybe 110 percent.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.850
Just to give a tiny bit more spacing.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.410
Now I can select these different elements and just position them

04:36.360 --> 04:38.400
got 20 pixels here.

04:38.840 --> 04:44.570
I'll probably put maybe 50 pixels one two three four five 50 pixels in between these two.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.540
And same thing here.

04:48.610 --> 04:54.640
One two three four or five and we've got 50 pixels so we already added some text.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.970
Got a really nice sizing here.

04:56.980 --> 05:02.800
I'm just going to use Option Command C as a shortcut to copy the style An Option Command V to paste

05:02.800 --> 05:04.830
this in the prime rib roast.

05:04.840 --> 05:11.710
So we've got that styling down here and now I want to show you why I didn't capitalize this but I did

05:11.710 --> 05:18.190
capitalize this so if you type things in caps it's hard to have control over changing the capitalization

05:18.190 --> 05:18.630
later.

05:18.640 --> 05:25.300
But if you have this all lowercase here I can quickly go into a bunch of text in my design file and

05:25.300 --> 05:28.780
I can go and choose to transform this text to all uppercase here.

05:28.990 --> 05:34.960
So you have a lot more flexibility and what that font is going to look like is you design further out.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.040
And lastly I'm going to copy the style here and paste it right here.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.100
And I think that's looking really good.

05:41.410 --> 05:46.720
Now I've already formatted all this text and rather than use the copy style paste style a bunch of times

05:47.620 --> 05:54.220
I might find out that later I want this text to not be completely black but I want it to be a little

05:54.220 --> 05:55.060
bit lighter.

05:55.090 --> 06:00.820
So rather than clicking and trying to select everything in our art board we can click on one of these

06:01.150 --> 06:08.330
go under Edit and we can choose to select everything with the same style here so selecting all of these

06:08.340 --> 06:16.240
three and I can quickly go in here and say now the style I want the text to be just a tiny bit lighter.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.310
So something like this and you can see that it changed that for these two.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.570
But this right here has something different.

06:23.570 --> 06:27.110
There's something different in the style and that's the line spacing here.

06:27.560 --> 06:33.120
So Option Command see Option Command B and we have that same type of styling.

06:33.590 --> 06:40.680
What's really great though is you don't have to rely on one style for this entire text box field.

06:40.700 --> 06:48.320
So for example as far as the amount of ingredients that we have here I want this to be bold and I want

06:48.320 --> 06:50.390
that to be totally black.

06:50.540 --> 06:58.090
So once I change that you can definitely see the difference between the amount and the actual ingredient.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.460
So I can do the same thing here.

07:03.370 --> 07:04.700
This black and bold

07:27.500 --> 07:32.540
and we can change that independent of the other characters in this bounding box.
