00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,110
A recipe design it's finally starting to come to life.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,150
And to help this along let's add some images here in the homescreen and the recipe Detail Screen to

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,040
find the images we want to import here.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,610
Let's go to the shape tools and go to place image.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,440
And here we can find our assets folder and inside the assets folder there are a few entrée images.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,310
So the first one I'm going to import is this prime rib a j peg.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,870
So I can click open here and now if I hover over any of these boxes I can place this inside of that

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,550
boxed area.

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,080
So I want to place it right here.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,150
But I also want to place that same image right here.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,270
So set of going into the shapes tools again and going to place image I can right click on this and go

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,920
to copy style.

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,740
Right click on this area and paste style.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,380
And the reason why that works is because this is a feel style where the image was placed as a fill.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,870
Now there may be times you want to adjust the image within this square.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,420
For example if I click on this square here you can see how things resize and it kind of fits to feel.

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,550
But if I double click inside of here what I want to have happen is I want to move this image actually

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,280
inside of this rectangle.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,580
Well I can't do that because this is an image feel and not an image mask.

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,450
But there are a number of ways I can get around this.

21
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:33,140
So if I move this over here and this is 220 pixels Let's put 220 pixels tall and I can go to my rectangle

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,680
tool.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,490
I'm going to create a rectangle again here that's 220 pixels and all fine tune this here to 20.

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,650
And just snap this to the edge here.

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,390
So I've recreated this and if I hold down option command and the left bracket here I can move this clear

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,340
down in the léa schemes.

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,740
That's just a quick shortcut option command right bracket to bring to the top or left bracket to bring

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,650
it to the bottom.

29
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,090
That's the same as just dragging this around.

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,260
Now I can click on this image and if I click on this hold down shift and click on the image behind it

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,840
I can use this use as mask option here.

32
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,420
And what that does is it sets this back rectangle here as just a mask.

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,660
And so I can still click on this image and I can drag it around.

34
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:32,780
I can resize it and manually place this exactly how I want it inside of this area.

35
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,670
It's maybe nice if you place in the image and things are cropped out that you want to appear in the

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,240
image you want to slide something down or place it just right.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,800
You can do it this way.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,810
But there's also another option.

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,070
So I'm going to hit command z a few times and just to get rid of this rectangle here.

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:01,060
And now we're back to just this image again if I double quick I can't really move this around within

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,640
the cropped area but a quicker way of doing this is actually going into this image menu here.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,680
And choosing crop and now that I have crop enabled I can still click on this image here and maneuver

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,780
it and even resize this.

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,850
So those are just two ways of masking the image either using a crop or masking that image with another

45
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,720
shape.

46
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,760
For the most part you're probably just going to want to go in here and choose Krok but some areas where

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,100
you may want to use the mask for example is if you have a circle.

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,190
And I'm just going to tap the O keyboard shortcut and draw a circle right here and I'm going to hold

49
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,750
down option and copy this image and with Option Command right bracket I can bring this to the top.

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,780
So things like this you can't use that crop setting.

51
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:01,010
So I can still shift click to select this circle with this image and if I click on use as mask.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,930
Now I have things masked within this circle or this shape.

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,300
So there are multiple ways to do this and some have better results than others in the application that

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,340
you're using it.

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,720
So I would just keep that in mind while you're using the crop or just the use as a mask feature.

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,590
Lastly we have two other images here that we need to import.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,420
So I'm just going to go to my assets folder here and we'll import these two entry images.

58
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,710
And you notice when I just drag them in from the Finder window then they show up is really large.

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:44,960
So I can just resize this down and I can just shift select this image here use as mask.

60
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:52,020
New this around how I want it to look and notice when I drag this image out side of the frame.

61
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,200
It kind of places this in the background so it need to be a little bit careful of that.

62
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's move this up here.

63
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:09,690
And same thing here I'm going to resize this little bit in porches rather really large OK.

64
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,370
And we'll slip these two and use as mask

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,450
and

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,450
bring this over here.

67
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,320
And you can see this one outside of the frame so I can just command X quick on the frame command.

68
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,370
Make sure it's pasted back in the frame here.

69
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,980
Now that we have these images all mask the last thing to do is add a drop shadow and a corner radius.

70
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,640
So here I'm just going to have a radius of five pixels and we'll do the same thing on these images here

71
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,510
five pixels

72
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,940
and less quick on effects drop shadow.

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,400
And we're going to just turn this down to maybe two pixels here and then here we're going to add another

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
drop shadow

75
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,080
and we'll add one more drop shuttle so we're adding to drop shadows here one of them is a really sharp

76
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:25,590
drop shadow one and this one I want maybe 10 pixels in a Blair to be 20 pixels something like this and

77
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,370
the shading to be 10 percent.

78
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,450
So now we have all of our image masked.

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,540
We have some nice shadow effects on those massive images.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,410
And everything's looking good.
