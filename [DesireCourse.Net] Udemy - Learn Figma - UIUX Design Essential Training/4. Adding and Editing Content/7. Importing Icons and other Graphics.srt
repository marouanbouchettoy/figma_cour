1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,090
In a previous video we created these icons like this hamburger menu and this spotlight here and even

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,580
these stars but creating each little icon can sometimes be really cumbersome and there are thousands

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,030
of libraries out there that we can use inside of our design to get a design out quickly.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,090
You may also have some icons inside of Adobe Illustrator or some images that you find on Google or other

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,820
online resources and those formats are very easy to drag and drop.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,390
So I want to show you a few ways that you can import some icons in here and to do that let's get started

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,100
zooming into this home screen here.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,160
And now if we go into our assets folder we see that we have an icon here.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
Now we have this icon in three different formats.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,700
We have Adobe Illustrator P.N. G and S Ficci.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,840
Now unfortunately right now if I try to drag and drop this Adobe Illustrator file in here you can see

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,790
that this failed to import so thick that doesn't recognize the Adobe Illustrator file completely.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:06,060
But if I double click and open this Adobe Illustrator file you can see this common vector graphic and

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,120
we can actually click commands see we can go into Sigma and click command.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,490
And this pace the SPG directly inside of Sigma.

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,140
And this actually paste this is a group.

17
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,410
And if we drill down we can see that this is actually a vector image.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,220
So the first thing we do when we import is just hold down shift command g a few times.

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,230
And now we have this vector graphic all vectorized If we zoom in here we can still double click and

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,620
edit this graphic exactly how we would if we created this inside of Sigma.

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,180
Another way that we can import this graphic is through a pian g This is a portable networked graphic

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,270
it's almost the same as an image.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,680
And we can see when we import this in it's a raster graphic meaning it's calculating the pixels here

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,930
and behaves like an image instead of a vector graphic.

25
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,970
The downside to something like this is you don't have the same editing capabilities as something like

26
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,900
SPG or Adobe Illustrator files where you can edit these and manipulate the files themselves with the

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,760
image because this icon has an image.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,760
If we click inside of this area we have some image editing controls which doesn't work too well with

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,210
just a black icon and there are some ways to get around maybe the color of this so we can still go onto

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:31,500
this image and add a field for example and I can click inside of this and choose a solid fill say I

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,050
want to choose the same red icon here.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,890
So I change it to red to what that did was it overlaid a red fill over top of the entire rectangle that

33
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,220
this image is inside.

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,060
I can hack my way into incorporating this red inside of this image by clicking on some of these overlay

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,090
controls.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:58,100
And you can see that I have Darkon multiply color burn and if I choose something like light in what

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,720
that will do is apply this red on any dark elements so I can still change the color.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,490
Now change this to any color that I want but I have very basic editing controls.

39
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,510
And now if I hold down a command and zoom out you can see it still looks really decent as it's smaller.

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,770
But if I want to use this is any larger size here I'm going to get that pixelation for the most part

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,870
you're going to want to add to all of your icons in SVGA and find Ficci files.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,120
And that brings us to our last file format.

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
This is Fiji.

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,940
So if you're in a program like Adobe Illustrator you can export any of your icons or graphics into FICCI

45
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,130
and that behaves the same way as copying and pasting.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,520
So I still have this where I can change this color to red and I can double click inside of here and

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,140
I have the same editing controls and it's very handy.

48
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,240
So I'm going to delete these and I'll use this little comment icon.

49
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,810
And we want to have two other icons.

50
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,370
You want a heart and a timer.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,700
So in order to get those icons there's a tool that's really handy.

52
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
And this is a tool I use all the time.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,370
If you go to Icahn's 8 dot com you can search for any kind of icon here so I'll just search for heart

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,980
and you can see how many versions of the heart icon that we have.

55
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,310
And same thing with a timer.

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,700
So I'll just type in timer here and hit return.

57
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:33,630
And I have multiple timers now Icahn's 8 is free it's free to download these icons as a P and G and

58
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,720
remember that PMG is not very editable.

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,900
So if you want SVGA access there's a paid version and if you click see pricing here you can see that

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,820
it's $20 a month.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,750
And it gives you access to hundreds of thousands of graphics whether you get the free version or the

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,410
paid version.

63
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,390
They do have a desktop app and this app is actually right here.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
This ikons 8 menu bar.

65
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,500
So if I click on that you can see this pulls up right inside of my Mac and if you have the free version

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,500
again you only have this PLG option where you can drag and drop pian GS inside of here.

67
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:17,360
But because I have a paid version SVGA I can quickly search for icons like heart and I can find something

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,840
like this.

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,090
I think that looks good.

70
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,170
And I want to find a timer.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,490
I can just type timer and I like this one.

72
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,960
It was going to drag and drop this inside and you can see the difference between this pian Geographic

73
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,540
and this SPG last thing I'm going to select these two and just hold down shift command Jeeta ungroup

74
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,030
this a few times.

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,950
And now I want the height of all of these to be the same.

76
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,270
So I'm going to lock the proportions can make the height.

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,670
Let's just say 20 pixels for now.

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,590
And you can see even though the height is 20 pixels they're not proportionally to scale.

79
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:04,610
So what I like to do is match the height first and then do some visual balance so we probably want to

80
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,040
be somewhat smaller here.

81
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,400
And if I was to focus more closely on matching the icons I'd probably have a timer with a thinner weight

82
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,290
on it.

83
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,840
But this is good enough I think and do something like this.

84
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,080
And we can change this field to this red color here and now let's zoom out.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,260
So the comment over here the heart here and the time are over here.

86
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,340
I'm just going to add a little bit of text to clicking the Tiki and I'll just call this five hour

87
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,490
685

88
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,190
and one of seven.

89
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,650
So I'm just going to make sure that these are about four pixels away from the icon.

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,910
And I just like to nudge with my arrow keys once I hold down option I can kind of see what spacing looks

91
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,040
like.

92
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:19,370
And now all align this to the center and group these as one object so that I can align and distribute

93
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,740
them evenly.

94
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,720
OK.

95
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,950
Now that we have this set up you can move this down to be a little bit more balanced.

96
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,540
We have some nice icons here from Icons 8 from Adobe Illustrator and ones that we've created.

97
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,740
Last thing to do here is delete this pian Geographic.

98
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,080
And we should be all set.
