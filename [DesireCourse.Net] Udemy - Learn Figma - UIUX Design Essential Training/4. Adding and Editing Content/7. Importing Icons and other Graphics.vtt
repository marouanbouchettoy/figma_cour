00:00.300 --> 00:06.090
In a previous video we created these icons like this hamburger menu and this spotlight here and even

00:06.090 --> 00:11.580
these stars but creating each little icon can sometimes be really cumbersome and there are thousands

00:11.580 --> 00:17.030
of libraries out there that we can use inside of our design to get a design out quickly.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.090
You may also have some icons inside of Adobe Illustrator or some images that you find on Google or other

00:24.090 --> 00:27.820
online resources and those formats are very easy to drag and drop.

00:27.820 --> 00:33.390
So I want to show you a few ways that you can import some icons in here and to do that let's get started

00:33.390 --> 00:36.100
zooming into this home screen here.

00:36.360 --> 00:43.160
And now if we go into our assets folder we see that we have an icon here.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.360
Now we have this icon in three different formats.

00:45.360 --> 00:49.700
We have Adobe Illustrator P.N. G and S Ficci.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.840
Now unfortunately right now if I try to drag and drop this Adobe Illustrator file in here you can see

00:54.840 --> 00:59.790
that this failed to import so thick that doesn't recognize the Adobe Illustrator file completely.

00:59.790 --> 01:06.060
But if I double click and open this Adobe Illustrator file you can see this common vector graphic and

01:06.060 --> 01:11.120
we can actually click commands see we can go into Sigma and click command.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.490
And this pace the SPG directly inside of Sigma.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.140
And this actually paste this is a group.

01:18.150 --> 01:21.410
And if we drill down we can see that this is actually a vector image.

01:21.450 --> 01:27.220
So the first thing we do when we import is just hold down shift command g a few times.

01:27.390 --> 01:34.230
And now we have this vector graphic all vectorized If we zoom in here we can still double click and

01:34.290 --> 01:38.620
edit this graphic exactly how we would if we created this inside of Sigma.

01:38.670 --> 01:44.180
Another way that we can import this graphic is through a pian g This is a portable networked graphic

01:44.190 --> 01:46.270
it's almost the same as an image.

01:46.500 --> 01:52.680
And we can see when we import this in it's a raster graphic meaning it's calculating the pixels here

01:53.190 --> 01:57.930
and behaves like an image instead of a vector graphic.

01:57.930 --> 02:02.970
The downside to something like this is you don't have the same editing capabilities as something like

02:03.050 --> 02:09.900
SPG or Adobe Illustrator files where you can edit these and manipulate the files themselves with the

02:09.900 --> 02:11.760
image because this icon has an image.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.760
If we click inside of this area we have some image editing controls which doesn't work too well with

02:17.760 --> 02:24.210
just a black icon and there are some ways to get around maybe the color of this so we can still go onto

02:24.210 --> 02:31.500
this image and add a field for example and I can click inside of this and choose a solid fill say I

02:31.500 --> 02:34.050
want to choose the same red icon here.

02:34.320 --> 02:40.890
So I change it to red to what that did was it overlaid a red fill over top of the entire rectangle that

02:40.890 --> 02:42.220
this image is inside.

02:42.300 --> 02:48.060
I can hack my way into incorporating this red inside of this image by clicking on some of these overlay

02:48.060 --> 02:49.090
controls.

02:49.110 --> 02:58.100
And you can see that I have Darkon multiply color burn and if I choose something like light in what

02:58.100 --> 03:03.720
that will do is apply this red on any dark elements so I can still change the color.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.490
Now change this to any color that I want but I have very basic editing controls.

03:09.530 --> 03:15.510
And now if I hold down a command and zoom out you can see it still looks really decent as it's smaller.

03:15.740 --> 03:21.770
But if I want to use this is any larger size here I'm going to get that pixelation for the most part

03:21.770 --> 03:26.870
you're going to want to add to all of your icons in SVGA and find Ficci files.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.120
And that brings us to our last file format.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.680
This is Fiji.

03:30.710 --> 03:36.940
So if you're in a program like Adobe Illustrator you can export any of your icons or graphics into FICCI

03:37.330 --> 03:40.130
and that behaves the same way as copying and pasting.

03:40.400 --> 03:46.520
So I still have this where I can change this color to red and I can double click inside of here and

03:46.520 --> 03:52.140
I have the same editing controls and it's very handy.

03:52.140 --> 03:57.240
So I'm going to delete these and I'll use this little comment icon.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.810
And we want to have two other icons.

03:58.820 --> 04:01.370
You want a heart and a timer.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.700
So in order to get those icons there's a tool that's really handy.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.000
And this is a tool I use all the time.

04:08.400 --> 04:14.370
If you go to Icahn's 8 dot com you can search for any kind of icon here so I'll just search for heart

04:15.180 --> 04:18.980
and you can see how many versions of the heart icon that we have.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.310
And same thing with a timer.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.700
So I'll just type in timer here and hit return.

04:24.950 --> 04:33.630
And I have multiple timers now Icahn's 8 is free it's free to download these icons as a P and G and

04:33.630 --> 04:36.720
remember that PMG is not very editable.

04:36.720 --> 04:42.900
So if you want SVGA access there's a paid version and if you click see pricing here you can see that

04:42.900 --> 04:44.820
it's $20 a month.

04:45.720 --> 04:51.750
And it gives you access to hundreds of thousands of graphics whether you get the free version or the

04:51.750 --> 04:52.410
paid version.

04:52.410 --> 04:56.390
They do have a desktop app and this app is actually right here.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.100
This ikons 8 menu bar.

04:58.100 --> 05:04.500
So if I click on that you can see this pulls up right inside of my Mac and if you have the free version

05:04.500 --> 05:09.500
again you only have this PLG option where you can drag and drop pian GS inside of here.

05:09.690 --> 05:17.360
But because I have a paid version SVGA I can quickly search for icons like heart and I can find something

05:17.360 --> 05:17.840
like this.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.090
I think that looks good.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.170
And I want to find a timer.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.490
I can just type timer and I like this one.

05:26.580 --> 05:31.960
It was going to drag and drop this inside and you can see the difference between this pian Geographic

05:32.350 --> 05:38.540
and this SPG last thing I'm going to select these two and just hold down shift command Jeeta ungroup

05:38.580 --> 05:40.030
this a few times.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.950
And now I want the height of all of these to be the same.

05:44.980 --> 05:48.270
So I'm going to lock the proportions can make the height.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.670
Let's just say 20 pixels for now.

05:51.100 --> 05:56.590
And you can see even though the height is 20 pixels they're not proportionally to scale.

05:57.620 --> 06:04.610
So what I like to do is match the height first and then do some visual balance so we probably want to

06:04.610 --> 06:07.040
be somewhat smaller here.

06:08.150 --> 06:13.400
And if I was to focus more closely on matching the icons I'd probably have a timer with a thinner weight

06:13.970 --> 06:14.290
on it.

06:14.300 --> 06:19.840
But this is good enough I think and do something like this.

06:21.050 --> 06:28.080
And we can change this field to this red color here and now let's zoom out.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.260
So the comment over here the heart here and the time are over here.

06:35.450 --> 06:41.340
I'm just going to add a little bit of text to clicking the Tiki and I'll just call this five hour

06:45.150 --> 06:46.490
685

06:48.920 --> 06:56.190
and one of seven.

06:56.270 --> 07:02.650
So I'm just going to make sure that these are about four pixels away from the icon.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.910
And I just like to nudge with my arrow keys once I hold down option I can kind of see what spacing looks

07:07.910 --> 07:09.040
like.

07:09.140 --> 07:19.370
And now all align this to the center and group these as one object so that I can align and distribute

07:19.370 --> 07:20.740
them evenly.

07:25.410 --> 07:25.720
OK.

07:25.730 --> 07:30.950
Now that we have this set up you can move this down to be a little bit more balanced.

07:34.360 --> 07:40.540
We have some nice icons here from Icons 8 from Adobe Illustrator and ones that we've created.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.740
Last thing to do here is delete this pian Geographic.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.080
And we should be all set.
