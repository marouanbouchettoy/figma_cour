1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,050
Let's talk in more detail about color and to start off with this video I want to show you something

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,670
really cool.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,340
Now over the course of these videos we've been using the same color red here throughout a lot of our

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,190
art boards.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,880
So what happens when the primary colors need to change mid design.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,720
Well we can click on this icon here because we know that we use the same red as we've used across the

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,070
rest of this project.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,740
And it's as easy as clicking this edit button right here.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,740
We can choose to select every object in this file that has the same feel.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,280
So now all of this is selected and I can choose to change this field to blue and automatically our entire

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,080
project now has this blue style guide incorporated.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,470
So that's one really quick way to test out new colors and new styles across many our boards in your

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,370
project.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,310
Was going to click this go back to select all with the same fill and I'll choose to change this back

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,200
to read here.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,780
And you can really change it to any color that you want.

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,930
So that's just one powerful way of using some of these filters to select things.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,670
It's the same thing with stroke or different shadow effects if you want to change the shadow effects

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,060
across the project.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,160
That all works the same way.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,580
And now with this background color here that we created for the splash screen that's this rectangle

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,210
right here we can see that we already added a color feel over top of an image file but we can add multiple

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,970
color fills so I can click on the plus icon click on this little color thumbnail and we have a number

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:40,190
of options to add more color to the design so I'm going to click on radial here and we can see that

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,970
we have a nice radial image with some anchor handles here to control the width of this radial and also

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,630
the height.

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,100
Here are the size and we can change the opacity here.

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,490
I'm going to change this to 30 percent.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,990
Let's try 60 percent here just to make it a little bit brighter.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,620
And again if I click in here I can decide where the Beginning and End Point is of this.

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,580
So maybe if I want to start inside this hand here and then I can have the endpoint something like this

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,380
and the width I want it to be a little bit wider.

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,600
And you can really just play around with this and you can have a combination of different effects here.

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,640
Now inside of the color panel itself if we click on this fill for example we have a number of ways we

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,310
can control the color.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,410
We have the color controls down here and the saturation controls in here.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,420
We also have the hex value.

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,070
So if you have any other colors that you want to copy from any other program like Adobe Illustrator

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,490
or anywhere else you can paste them as a hex value or if there are G-B you can paste those in here.

40
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,540
You also have CSSA values so if you have CSSA properties do you want to copy and paste in here to copy

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,200
those colors.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,250
You can do that.

43
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,760
And then the HSP values.

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,310
So there are a number of ways that you can add copy and paste colors or paste them outside of here into

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,870
other projects.

46
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,220
Another way we can use colors.

47
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,710
Let's go into this recipe details frame here.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,810
And let's look at just this prime rib roast title here.

49
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,500
So I'm just going to zoom in and let's say we spend a little bit trying to find a good color for these

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,200
headers.

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm going to start out with this blue color here and that looks decent but it's not dark enough for

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,160
me so I'm just going to pull this down just a little bit and we can see that looks like a really good

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,990
color and contrast with this red and we have the hex value here so we could copy this hex value and

54
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,710
we can paste this anywhere else we want to copy that same color.

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,730
So I can click inside of here and just do a quick command B and enter and we can paste it that way.

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,490
But we know that we're going to reuse this throughout our project quite a bit.

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,990
So if I want I can scroll down here and you can see that I have a few color choices.

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,810
This is the document colors.

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,400
So these are all the colors that have been used in the document and I can just click here to copy that

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,530
same color.

61
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,030
Or I can choose personal colors.

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,860
These are in my personal collection.

63
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,920
Every time I open figment this is going to be the same palette of colors.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,550
And then I have a chef team colors.

65
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,380
Now you remember in a previous video we created a new team for this recipe's app.

66
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,400
So by doing that we can save this color inside of the color palette anywhere that we want.

67
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,470
I'm going to save this inside of my personal colors as well because I really like this color.

68
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,300
So now.

69
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,450
Because it's in my personal colors I can create a new file here.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,990
This file is completely separate from the other file we were working on.

71
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,690
And if I just draw a rectangle for demo purposes I can click on fill go into my personal colors and

72
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,060
I still have that same color that I can reuse throughout multiple files.

73
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,700
Now you may also notice that we have an opacity control here and when we dial this left and right we

74
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,610
can see that that changes here.

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,780
So you have quick access to change the opacity here or down here.

76
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,870
So I someone to leave this at the dark blue.

77
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,640
And one final way to grab and reuse color is if we have a color inside of an image for example that

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,720
we want to reuse we can't just double click in here and find out what the field color is for an image

79
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,730
but let's say there's some green inside of here that we want to reuse inside of our project.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,980
Well we can click on any piece of text and I can hold down control C and get this little eyedropper

81
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,860
and it'll show you the hex value here on the top right as you're moving along your mouse to the different

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,710
colors.

83
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:55,210
Or if you click on this color thumbnail you can see that same control here this eyedropper control.

84
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,660
So I'm going to click on this eyedropper tool and I'm going to choose to select a color somewhere around

85
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,870
this area here.

86
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,650
And so very quickly you can grab a color like that and you can save that in your palette for later if

87
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,760
you want to use it.

88
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,610
I actually really like this blue color so I'm going to click back in this color palette and you can

89
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,410
see when I clicked on.

90
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,430
I'm actually using the eyedropper tool still but it gives me the same hex value.

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,680
So those are a few ways you can use the color panel inside of your file or inside of your stroke.
