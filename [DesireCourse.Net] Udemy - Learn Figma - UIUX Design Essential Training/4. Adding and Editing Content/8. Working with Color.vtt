00:01.700 --> 00:06.050
Let's talk in more detail about color and to start off with this video I want to show you something

00:06.050 --> 00:07.670
really cool.

00:07.670 --> 00:13.340
Now over the course of these videos we've been using the same color red here throughout a lot of our

00:13.340 --> 00:14.190
art boards.

00:14.330 --> 00:17.880
So what happens when the primary colors need to change mid design.

00:18.080 --> 00:23.720
Well we can click on this icon here because we know that we use the same red as we've used across the

00:23.720 --> 00:25.070
rest of this project.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.740
And it's as easy as clicking this edit button right here.

00:27.740 --> 00:33.740
We can choose to select every object in this file that has the same feel.

00:33.800 --> 00:40.280
So now all of this is selected and I can choose to change this field to blue and automatically our entire

00:40.280 --> 00:45.080
project now has this blue style guide incorporated.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.470
So that's one really quick way to test out new colors and new styles across many our boards in your

00:51.470 --> 00:52.370
project.

00:52.400 --> 00:58.310
Was going to click this go back to select all with the same fill and I'll choose to change this back

00:58.310 --> 00:59.200
to read here.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.780
And you can really change it to any color that you want.

01:02.030 --> 01:05.930
So that's just one powerful way of using some of these filters to select things.

01:05.930 --> 01:10.670
It's the same thing with stroke or different shadow effects if you want to change the shadow effects

01:10.670 --> 01:12.060
across the project.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.160
That all works the same way.

01:14.570 --> 01:19.580
And now with this background color here that we created for the splash screen that's this rectangle

01:19.580 --> 01:26.210
right here we can see that we already added a color feel over top of an image file but we can add multiple

01:26.210 --> 01:31.970
color fills so I can click on the plus icon click on this little color thumbnail and we have a number

01:31.970 --> 01:40.190
of options to add more color to the design so I'm going to click on radial here and we can see that

01:40.190 --> 01:46.970
we have a nice radial image with some anchor handles here to control the width of this radial and also

01:46.970 --> 01:47.630
the height.

01:47.630 --> 01:52.100
Here are the size and we can change the opacity here.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.490
I'm going to change this to 30 percent.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.990
Let's try 60 percent here just to make it a little bit brighter.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.620
And again if I click in here I can decide where the Beginning and End Point is of this.

02:03.620 --> 02:10.580
So maybe if I want to start inside this hand here and then I can have the endpoint something like this

02:11.540 --> 02:16.380
and the width I want it to be a little bit wider.

02:16.780 --> 02:22.600
And you can really just play around with this and you can have a combination of different effects here.

02:22.650 --> 02:29.640
Now inside of the color panel itself if we click on this fill for example we have a number of ways we

02:29.640 --> 02:31.310
can control the color.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.410
We have the color controls down here and the saturation controls in here.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.420
We also have the hex value.

02:39.410 --> 02:44.070
So if you have any other colors that you want to copy from any other program like Adobe Illustrator

02:44.460 --> 02:51.490
or anywhere else you can paste them as a hex value or if there are G-B you can paste those in here.

02:51.540 --> 02:57.540
You also have CSSA values so if you have CSSA properties do you want to copy and paste in here to copy

02:57.540 --> 02:58.200
those colors.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.250
You can do that.

02:59.670 --> 03:02.760
And then the HSP values.

03:02.790 --> 03:08.310
So there are a number of ways that you can add copy and paste colors or paste them outside of here into

03:08.310 --> 03:09.870
other projects.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.220
Another way we can use colors.

03:11.220 --> 03:15.710
Let's go into this recipe details frame here.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.810
And let's look at just this prime rib roast title here.

03:18.810 --> 03:25.500
So I'm just going to zoom in and let's say we spend a little bit trying to find a good color for these

03:25.500 --> 03:26.200
headers.

03:27.110 --> 03:32.360
I'm going to start out with this blue color here and that looks decent but it's not dark enough for

03:32.360 --> 03:37.160
me so I'm just going to pull this down just a little bit and we can see that looks like a really good

03:37.160 --> 03:44.990
color and contrast with this red and we have the hex value here so we could copy this hex value and

03:44.990 --> 03:49.710
we can paste this anywhere else we want to copy that same color.

03:49.730 --> 03:56.730
So I can click inside of here and just do a quick command B and enter and we can paste it that way.

03:56.750 --> 04:00.490
But we know that we're going to reuse this throughout our project quite a bit.

04:01.780 --> 04:07.990
So if I want I can scroll down here and you can see that I have a few color choices.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.810
This is the document colors.

04:09.910 --> 04:15.400
So these are all the colors that have been used in the document and I can just click here to copy that

04:15.400 --> 04:16.530
same color.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.030
Or I can choose personal colors.

04:19.030 --> 04:20.860
These are in my personal collection.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.920
Every time I open figment this is going to be the same palette of colors.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.550
And then I have a chef team colors.

04:28.580 --> 04:33.380
Now you remember in a previous video we created a new team for this recipe's app.

04:33.650 --> 04:39.400
So by doing that we can save this color inside of the color palette anywhere that we want.

04:39.410 --> 04:43.470
I'm going to save this inside of my personal colors as well because I really like this color.

04:43.730 --> 04:44.300
So now.

04:44.330 --> 04:48.450
Because it's in my personal colors I can create a new file here.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.990
This file is completely separate from the other file we were working on.

04:53.210 --> 04:59.690
And if I just draw a rectangle for demo purposes I can click on fill go into my personal colors and

04:59.690 --> 05:03.060
I still have that same color that I can reuse throughout multiple files.

05:03.060 --> 05:09.700
Now you may also notice that we have an opacity control here and when we dial this left and right we

05:09.700 --> 05:11.610
can see that that changes here.

05:11.620 --> 05:15.780
So you have quick access to change the opacity here or down here.

05:15.790 --> 05:18.870
So I someone to leave this at the dark blue.

05:18.940 --> 05:24.640
And one final way to grab and reuse color is if we have a color inside of an image for example that

05:24.640 --> 05:29.720
we want to reuse we can't just double click in here and find out what the field color is for an image

05:30.250 --> 05:34.730
but let's say there's some green inside of here that we want to reuse inside of our project.

05:35.200 --> 05:41.980
Well we can click on any piece of text and I can hold down control C and get this little eyedropper

05:42.430 --> 05:47.860
and it'll show you the hex value here on the top right as you're moving along your mouse to the different

05:47.860 --> 05:48.710
colors.

05:49.030 --> 05:55.210
Or if you click on this color thumbnail you can see that same control here this eyedropper control.

05:55.270 --> 06:01.660
So I'm going to click on this eyedropper tool and I'm going to choose to select a color somewhere around

06:02.620 --> 06:03.870
this area here.

06:04.180 --> 06:08.650
And so very quickly you can grab a color like that and you can save that in your palette for later if

06:08.650 --> 06:10.760
you want to use it.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.610
I actually really like this blue color so I'm going to click back in this color palette and you can

06:15.610 --> 06:16.410
see when I clicked on.

06:16.450 --> 06:21.430
I'm actually using the eyedropper tool still but it gives me the same hex value.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.680
So those are a few ways you can use the color panel inside of your file or inside of your stroke.
