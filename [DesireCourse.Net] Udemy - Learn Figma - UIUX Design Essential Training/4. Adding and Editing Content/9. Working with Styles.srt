00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,480
In this video we're going to start designing a recipe completed screen.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,590
And by doing this we're going to illustrate some of the style effects that we can create on a pop up

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,700
overlay.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,270
Before we go through how to add styles I want to go over here to the recipe details screen and I want

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,870
to copy some of these things over to recipe details complete so I could just hover over these elements

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,350
and copy and paste onto this our board or I can click on this art board itself and if I go to export

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,190
here I can click on this export and I'll just export this at to X and we can see a preview here of what

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,260
it's going to look like.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,310
And let's go ahead and export this as a PMG and you can export this anywhere that you want.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,830
I'm going to export this on my desktop and I want to bring it back into the projects so I can click

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:57,700
on the shape's tools click on place image and if I jump into my desktop you can see the recipe details

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,380
here.

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll just click Open and now I'll place this right inside of here and we can scale it however we like.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,930
And here this doesn't look exactly how we want it to.

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:17,230
And remember if we click on this image thumbnail we can use this crop feature and just pull this down

16
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:26,400
so we see the top of it and all this is is an image hit return here and now it's click inside of your

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,070
image to nudge this over to make sure that we have the layering correct.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,950
And now we copied this image inside of here.

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:40,090
And the reason why we did this is we want to create an overlay effect for a pop up menu.

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Now to create the overlay color we could click inside of here and add a feel that's a black solid feel

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,830
for example and we can do that and turn the opacity down to 40 percent to show that it's overlaid.

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,930
But if we do that we can add some effects to just this feel here.

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,890
So instead of doing that and going to click on this row and subtract and now all create a rectangle

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:14,470
and drag this over here and I want to create that same black feel with just subtle opacity here and

25
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,040
then one nice thing that I can do here is I can use this effects tool and instead of a draw shadow I

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,730
actually want a background color.

27
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,230
So I want the background of anything behind here to be blurred out.

28
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,950
And then I can change this to 20 pixels here to help it become a really blurry.

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,210
And now I can change the opacity here let's try 20 percent.

30
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,600
Or 30 percent and we can play with that as much as we want.

31
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,670
In fact I may choose to have this white here.

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,600
So now we have a blurred white background and if we drag this rectangle here you can see what it's doing

33
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,450
it's blurring everything behind this rectangle shape.

34
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,180
And I think that's looking really good.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
And now we want a pop up window telling us that our recipe is completed.

36
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,270
So we can create another rectangle here.

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,310
And I'm just going to make it maybe 240 by 300 right now

38
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,900
and we'll bring this down to the center.

39
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,520
And this may be resized as the content fits in.

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,660
And we're going to add new content in a future video.

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,390
So now I'll just change this color white I will add a five pixel radius to all the corners.

42
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,850
When I started to look good but we can see that there's very little or no contrast around the edges

43
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,260
here.

44
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,030
So one of the first things we want to do here is just add a subtle stroke

45
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:52,170
and then we want to jump into our effects once again and this time we just want to add a subtle drop

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:02,010
shadow and for pixel's looks good for pixel Blar it's down for pixels and 25 percent looks decent.

47
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,670
Now we may want to add another châteaux down below.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,580
That's a lot more blurry making this feel like it's popping out of the page quite a bit more.

49
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,270
So if we want to do that we can add a nother drop shadow inside of here.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,270
We can have this be 20 pixel Blar and we can see that that's really pop in that off the page and that's

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,840
starting to look really good I'm just going to decrease the opacity here.

52
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,510
And so this is starting to look really good.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,500
But another thing we can do to really help pronounce this pop up is draw a rectangle here to use as

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,380
a shadow.

55
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,400
And we'll just make this a little bit smaller than the rectangle here.

56
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,800
And I'm just going to bring this down a few layers.

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,230
There we go.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,130
And this rectangle can actually serve as a shadow.

59
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,710
And to do that we can change this color to black.

60
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,610
And now if we jump into and we can change the radius which changes to 30 pixels here.

61
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,050
And now if we go into effects instead of a background blur or a drop shadow or inner shadow that's to

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,810
a layer Buhler.

63
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,830
So it's only blurring this actual layer.

64
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:22,020
And here we want this blur to be 30 pixels Let's start out 30 unless tried maybe 50 pixels here.

65
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,770
So that's looking really good.

66
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,750
And then the actual opacity of this fill let's change this to 15 percent.

67
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,920
And you can hardly see that I'm going to try 30 percent.

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,300
Sometimes it's just trying a few numbers to see what works.

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,440
So that's starting to look decent here and we can just fiddle around with the sizes.

70
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,330
And what exactly we like.

71
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,130
And I'm going to change this to multiply.

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,700
And let's just tweak this little bit more to see what we like.

73
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,840
So we like that should be good.

74
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,950
So we have a nice completed screen here we have some dropshot effects some layer blur effects and some

75
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,720
background blur effects here.

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,580
And you can really play with a combination of these effects to get some really nice designs.
