00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,200
In chapter 4 we went over working with content.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,800
And that was working with framed shapes icons and a number of the different tools to apply those to

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,520
our design.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,550
So now that we have some well-rounded knowledge on how the tools work there are still some screens left

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,280
to be designed here and to apply the knowledge we gained in the previous chapters into completing our

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,140
design.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,450
So if you want you can go through these videos with me in completing these designs or you can open up

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,900
this chef recipe drawing Panjwaii located in your assets folder and design each one of these screens

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,780
based off of the sketches that you see here.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,390
Either way is fine with me.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,500
But if you want to follow along I'm just going to get started with this first video creating a slide

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,550
out menu here in the menus frame.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:57,610
So the first thing I want to do inside of here is create a rectangle using the Arkie for a shortcut

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,840
and just create this at 320 pixels and I'm going to use the same red color that we've been using in

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,860
previous videos and now that we have this component set up I can go into the components panel here and

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,220
drag and drop this button menu somewhere here and I can even line up with this one holding down shift

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,210
and selecting.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:27,190
I can align this to the top and then make sure that this has 20 pixels here against the edge of this

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,660
rectangle that will match the same 20 pixels here.

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,410
Now very quickly I'm going to add some text so I'll just use the keyboard command and I'm just gonna

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:53,360
start typing these in going to send this to left justify.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,490
OK so we have our four menu items.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,710
I'm going to quickly style this with white text and under the advanced menu I want to transform my text

24
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:13,310
to uppercase and I want the paragraph height to be 30 pixels here and this text can actually be let's

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,090
try 20 pixels right here.

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,960
So that's looking pretty decent maybe I'll have a medium.

27
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,420
And now all a lot of this with the edge and hold down shift and the right arrow two times or three times.

28
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,330
So we have our menu here.

29
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:39,520
And I also want to hit the key for a line and I'll just draw a line that's 30 pixels here and I'll make

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,150
this stroke white.

31
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,350
And this can probably be a 5 pixel stroke with the edges rounded.

32
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:56,820
So I'm going to cap this with a round cap and we can see here we are in popular recipes.

33
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,100
Now we want to hold down option and copy this text down here and just going to add some more text for

34
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:10,300
the user log in Harry Truman.

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,860
And if I tap the key for elipse

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,830
created 46 pixel circle she's going to dial that in here because I couldn't get it correct the first

37
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,540
time.

38
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,640
And now that I have this circle selected I'm going to go and fill this with an image.

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,590
It's going to ask me to choose the image and I'm going to go into my assets folder here and we can see

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,550
this avatar dot and g going to just go ahead and open this up here.

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,690
And we have Harry Truman profile image here.

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,500
So you can see very quickly we have our menu all designed and set up and in the next video we're going

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,540
to finish our pop up screen for the completed recipe.
