In chapter 4 we went over working with content.

00:04.230 --> 00:10.800
And that was working with framed shapes icons and a number of the different tools to apply those to

00:10.800 --> 00:11.520
our design.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.550
So now that we have some well-rounded knowledge on how the tools work there are still some screens left

00:17.550 --> 00:23.280
to be designed here and to apply the knowledge we gained in the previous chapters into completing our

00:23.280 --> 00:24.140
design.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.450
So if you want you can go through these videos with me in completing these designs or you can open up

00:30.450 --> 00:36.900
this chef recipe drawing Panjwaii located in your assets folder and design each one of these screens

00:36.900 --> 00:39.780
based off of the sketches that you see here.

00:39.780 --> 00:41.390
Either way is fine with me.

00:41.610 --> 00:46.500
But if you want to follow along I'm just going to get started with this first video creating a slide

00:46.500 --> 00:50.550
out menu here in the menus frame.

00:50.620 --> 00:57.610
So the first thing I want to do inside of here is create a rectangle using the Arkie for a shortcut

00:58.540 --> 01:04.840
and just create this at 320 pixels and I'm going to use the same red color that we've been using in

01:04.840 --> 01:11.860
previous videos and now that we have this component set up I can go into the components panel here and

01:11.890 --> 01:18.220
drag and drop this button menu somewhere here and I can even line up with this one holding down shift

01:18.220 --> 01:19.210
and selecting.

01:19.480 --> 01:27.190
I can align this to the top and then make sure that this has 20 pixels here against the edge of this

01:27.190 --> 01:29.660
rectangle that will match the same 20 pixels here.

01:29.860 --> 01:37.410
Now very quickly I'm going to add some text so I'll just use the keyboard command and I'm just gonna

01:37.410 --> 01:53.360
start typing these in going to send this to left justify.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.490
OK so we have our four menu items.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.710
I'm going to quickly style this with white text and under the advanced menu I want to transform my text

02:02.710 --> 02:13.310
to uppercase and I want the paragraph height to be 30 pixels here and this text can actually be let's

02:13.400 --> 02:16.090
try 20 pixels right here.

02:16.090 --> 02:20.960
So that's looking pretty decent maybe I'll have a medium.

02:21.130 --> 02:28.420
And now all a lot of this with the edge and hold down shift and the right arrow two times or three times.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.330
So we have our menu here.

02:30.430 --> 02:39.520
And I also want to hit the key for a line and I'll just draw a line that's 30 pixels here and I'll make

02:39.520 --> 02:41.150
this stroke white.

02:42.190 --> 02:47.350
And this can probably be a 5 pixel stroke with the edges rounded.

02:47.530 --> 02:56.820
So I'm going to cap this with a round cap and we can see here we are in popular recipes.

02:56.830 --> 03:03.100
Now we want to hold down option and copy this text down here and just going to add some more text for

03:03.100 --> 03:10.300
the user log in Harry Truman.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.860
And if I tap the key for elipse

03:16.000 --> 03:21.830
created 46 pixel circle she's going to dial that in here because I couldn't get it correct the first

03:21.830 --> 03:22.540
time.

03:22.790 --> 03:28.640
And now that I have this circle selected I'm going to go and fill this with an image.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.590
It's going to ask me to choose the image and I'm going to go into my assets folder here and we can see

03:33.590 --> 03:38.550
this avatar dot and g going to just go ahead and open this up here.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.690
And we have Harry Truman profile image here.

03:45.280 --> 03:50.500
So you can see very quickly we have our menu all designed and set up and in the next video we're going

03:50.500 --> 03:53.540
to finish our pop up screen for the completed recipe.
