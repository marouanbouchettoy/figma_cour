1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,650
In this video we're going to complete our on screen overlay screen.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,320
This is the screen that tells them you did it let your friends know about it or leave a review.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,660
So this screen will pop up as soon as they click on this last step here finalizing their preparation.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,290
And that's what we have here.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,430
So in a previous video under the stiles video we already learned how to overlay some of these layers

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,890
here so we have a rectangle with a nice background blur.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,810
We have this.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,290
This is just an image of this art board here.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,160
So we exported the image out.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,760
We imported it back into here and now we have these one two three four layers.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,750
So it's an image this blurred rectangle and then we have this pop up overlaid rectangle with some drop

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,150
shadows and we have this component that we created in an earlier video too.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,290
So let's complete the rest of this year.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,940
First off we need to add some text and the cool thing about previous our boards and some designs is

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,770
I can hold down option and just copy some of these things if I know it's going to be similar to the

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,200
same style so I can just type here.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,850
You'd get it.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,250
And right here I'll just use the same text.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,800
Let your friends know about it.

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:36,100
And here it's a little bit wider than I'd like so I can just change that here and holding down shift

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,770
I can touch this 10 pixels shift command left arrow left arrow.

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,260
I can resize this to be 10 pixels.

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,180
So now we have four icons of the Google Plus icon Twitter Facebook Instagram icon and if you want you

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,320
can use any icons that you find online for Google Plus Twitter Facebook and Instagram or if you go into

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,250
your assets folder.

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,190
We have four SVGA icons already for Google Instagram Twitter and Facebook.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,990
So if you want to just use these Lets just hold down shift to select all of these and I'm just going

28
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,010
to drag these in here and we can see that they are all inserted now.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,040
I want to lock the proportions and let's just make the height of each one of these 20 pixels right now

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,540
and I can already see that's a little bit big.

31
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,630
So I'm going to change this to 12 pixels and that looks a little bit better.

32
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,440
Now I can align these.

33
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,220
And the first thing I want to do with these icons here is wrap them in their own little circle.

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,530
So tapping the Oakey and creating a

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,080
20 pixel by pixel circle

36
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,490
I can make the circle red.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,420
And now we'll go in here

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,580
and we'll create all of these to be white will center these and bring them over here.

39
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,610
And if I zoom in here I can kind of see what's going on with this Google Plus is a little bit large.

40
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,430
So I'm going to scale this down a little bit.

41
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,920
The width will probably make 16 pixels

42
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,760
and we can play around with this a little bit later on too if they're too unbalanced.

43
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,380
So we'll start right here.

44
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,790
And the last thing here the Facebook icon we want to change this a little bit because we only want this

45
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,710
if we don't want this bounding box so we can double click inside of here a few times and let's look

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,560
at our layers panel you can see that this is groups there's an F and on there is a rounded rectangle.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,040
So I'm just going to delete this a rounded rectangle here and now we only have this F so now I can bring

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:03,230
this F over here and resize this and also look a little bit messy right now if we want to we can hide

49
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,930
some of these other ones here as we look at this.

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,430
F that's a lot better.

51
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,530
And now that we have all of these selected I'm just going to clean up these layers because it shows

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,020
them all grouped.

53
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,930
So let's just look all of these groups holding down shift and I'm going to select shift command G.

54
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:37,670
And now one more time shift Comanche and I'll just name this social Twitter social Instagram

55
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,480
social Google Plus

56
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,720
social Facebook.

57
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,580
And now I can select a circle and these other social icons you see sometimes and actually didn't put

58
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,140
this in the same frame as the circle.

59
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,200
Sometimes it's a little bit weird like that.

60
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,740
So we want to drag this back down where the circle is.

61
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm going to hold out command and select this circle as well and we'll just group everything by creating

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,310
a component.

63
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,590
And we're to call this the social component.

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,580
Now again we're going to hold down option and copy this and then all right click and move this to the

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,750
components page.

66
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,170
And now we have this child component.

67
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:32,540
This is where we want to start off with the Google Plus icon that will hold down option three more times

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,710
and copy this.

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:44,140
And this one we want to be Facebook here we want it to be Instagram.

70
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,700
And here we have this b Twitter.

71
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,570
So we've done a good job already.

72
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,320
But you can still see this is quite large compared to the circle.

73
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,470
So let's right click on one of these and we'll go to the master component and just jumping inside of

74
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,580
here.

75
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm going to hide each one and just go ahead and resize some of these things using this scale tool might

76
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,430
help something like that I think will look good.

77
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,010
Let's center that in the our board is Google Plus.

78
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,980
Bring that down a little bit more.

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,880
Instagram skill add a little something like this and same thing with Twitter

80
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:51,040
center that we can jump back into our pages or page one and see how that all looks.

81
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,610
And one thing I forgot to do I'm going to jump back into components is unhide the rest of these.

82
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,680
Jump back in here.

83
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,040
And that looks far more balanced.

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,850
Now the last thing I want to do is add some text here to leave a review

85
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,680
and now we want to center all of these things on the watch when I click to drag a drag handle to select

86
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,580
everything I'm actually dragging these things behind.

87
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,300
So this is where the lock layers will come in really handy these two layers right here.

88
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,120
I want to lock now I can click and drag to select everything here except for these circles.

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,710
Hold down shift and just click to de-select those.

90
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:43,030
And now I can align horizontal centers here and I'll align everything here to the frame and also the

91
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,940
center of the frame right here.

92
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:58,660
Now I can start to align some of these items so I could just choose to add 10 pixels between each of

93
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,050
these icons.

94
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,030
But then right next to each other.

95
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,610
Hold down shift and the right arrow key.

96
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,710
But this next to G shift right arrow key.

97
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

98
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:23,320
So now let's center this with the overlay and let's put a nice 20 pixels in between there and zero pixels

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,150
in between here

100
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
and one to three That's 20 pixels.

101
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,550
I'm going hold down shift and one more I'm going to have that 30 pixels here and then down here I'm

102
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,980
going to add 30 pixels here.

103
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,530
And 10 pixels right here.

104
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,960
And when you're asking someone to leave a review here you want this all to be unfilled.

105
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:01,630
So because this is a component I can choose this first store to hide this field layer.

106
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,320
We're going to also hide this star.

107
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,940
Same thing here same thing here

108
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,920
and now it's blank and ready for them to leave a review.

109
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,060
Last thing I want to do is resize this.

110
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,530
So I want this to also have 30 pixels between the bottom of this pop up window.

111
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,670
And the bottom of these stars so we can see is 26 pixels right here.

112
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,410
So I guess I can just hold down command to resize and set of move and I'll tap this down or one two

113
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,550
three four and we have a nice 30 pixels here and 30 pixels here.

114
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,940
I'll move the shadow to be centered again.

115
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,240
And now I can select everything here.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,080
Hit Comanche to group it and just make sure that this is centered with the frame that it's inside.

117
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,160
The last thing I want to do is add an x ray here so I'll just quickly draw one.

118
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,840
We'll have this two pixels here have this rounded.

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,150
And now I'll select this line click command see Command V and quickly rotate.

120
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,190
And for some reason when you rotate it's rotating on this left axis which is a little bit weird but

121
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,070
I can just nudge this using the arrow keys to make it straight.

122
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,770
I just noticed that when I was working with lions they behave a little bit unpredictably but now that

123
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:39,830
I have this I can click on this union selection and now I have one nice fill all scroll out and I want

124
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:49,730
to rotate this to 45 degrees and that I can go into object and flatten this selection and change this

125
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:58,120
to be a nice even size will do 10 pixel by pixel and we'll just make this we hold down shift and nudge

126
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,470
this left once and right once it will just sit 10 pixels away from the edge there.

127
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,590
So now we have a nice pop up menu says you did it.

128
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,730
They can leave a review let their friends know or tap this X and jump back into the recipe.

129
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,080
Now I'm going to hit 0 to zoom out 100 percent see how that looks and it looks really good to me.

130
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,580
But sometimes you have some artifacts there's this edge right here that looks like this.

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,750
The edge of this isn't hitting the top even though it is.

132
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,880
So sometimes if you get that it doesn't hurt to grab this shape inside of here and just move it up past

133
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,040
the box just to make sure that you have everything filled inside up here.

134
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,810
So this is how you illustrate an overlay here.

135
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,910
You have to duplicate the image and then place some objects above this.
