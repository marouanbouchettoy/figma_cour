00:00.360 --> 00:04.650
In this video we're going to complete our on screen overlay screen.

00:04.830 --> 00:10.320
This is the screen that tells them you did it let your friends know about it or leave a review.

00:10.410 --> 00:17.660
So this screen will pop up as soon as they click on this last step here finalizing their preparation.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.290
And that's what we have here.

00:20.310 --> 00:26.430
So in a previous video under the stiles video we already learned how to overlay some of these layers

00:26.430 --> 00:29.890
here so we have a rectangle with a nice background blur.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.810
We have this.

00:30.810 --> 00:34.290
This is just an image of this art board here.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.160
So we exported the image out.

00:36.180 --> 00:44.760
We imported it back into here and now we have these one two three four layers.

00:44.820 --> 00:51.750
So it's an image this blurred rectangle and then we have this pop up overlaid rectangle with some drop

00:51.750 --> 00:57.150
shadows and we have this component that we created in an earlier video too.

00:57.210 --> 01:00.290
So let's complete the rest of this year.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.940
First off we need to add some text and the cool thing about previous our boards and some designs is

01:05.940 --> 01:10.770
I can hold down option and just copy some of these things if I know it's going to be similar to the

01:10.770 --> 01:15.200
same style so I can just type here.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.850
You'd get it.

01:18.540 --> 01:22.250
And right here I'll just use the same text.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.800
Let your friends know about it.

01:28.430 --> 01:36.100
And here it's a little bit wider than I'd like so I can just change that here and holding down shift

01:36.110 --> 01:40.770
I can touch this 10 pixels shift command left arrow left arrow.

01:41.150 --> 01:45.260
I can resize this to be 10 pixels.

01:45.560 --> 01:53.180
So now we have four icons of the Google Plus icon Twitter Facebook Instagram icon and if you want you

01:53.180 --> 02:00.320
can use any icons that you find online for Google Plus Twitter Facebook and Instagram or if you go into

02:00.320 --> 02:01.250
your assets folder.

02:01.250 --> 02:06.190
We have four SVGA icons already for Google Instagram Twitter and Facebook.

02:06.200 --> 02:11.990
So if you want to just use these Lets just hold down shift to select all of these and I'm just going

02:11.990 --> 02:16.010
to drag these in here and we can see that they are all inserted now.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.040
I want to lock the proportions and let's just make the height of each one of these 20 pixels right now

02:23.200 --> 02:25.540
and I can already see that's a little bit big.

02:25.820 --> 02:32.630
So I'm going to change this to 12 pixels and that looks a little bit better.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.440
Now I can align these.

02:34.910 --> 02:41.220
And the first thing I want to do with these icons here is wrap them in their own little circle.

02:41.630 --> 02:45.530
So tapping the Oakey and creating a

02:48.250 --> 02:51.080
20 pixel by pixel circle

02:54.250 --> 02:56.490
I can make the circle red.

02:57.190 --> 02:59.420
And now we'll go in here

03:02.660 --> 03:09.580
and we'll create all of these to be white will center these and bring them over here.

03:10.070 --> 03:16.610
And if I zoom in here I can kind of see what's going on with this Google Plus is a little bit large.

03:16.790 --> 03:19.430
So I'm going to scale this down a little bit.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.920
The width will probably make 16 pixels

03:24.970 --> 03:29.760
and we can play around with this a little bit later on too if they're too unbalanced.

03:29.780 --> 03:32.380
So we'll start right here.

03:32.540 --> 03:37.790
And the last thing here the Facebook icon we want to change this a little bit because we only want this

03:37.970 --> 03:42.710
if we don't want this bounding box so we can double click inside of here a few times and let's look

03:42.710 --> 03:47.560
at our layers panel you can see that this is groups there's an F and on there is a rounded rectangle.

03:47.560 --> 03:55.040
So I'm just going to delete this a rounded rectangle here and now we only have this F so now I can bring

03:55.040 --> 04:03.230
this F over here and resize this and also look a little bit messy right now if we want to we can hide

04:03.230 --> 04:06.930
some of these other ones here as we look at this.

04:07.010 --> 04:10.430
F that's a lot better.

04:11.510 --> 04:15.530
And now that we have all of these selected I'm just going to clean up these layers because it shows

04:15.530 --> 04:17.020
them all grouped.

04:17.570 --> 04:23.930
So let's just look all of these groups holding down shift and I'm going to select shift command G.

04:24.170 --> 04:37.670
And now one more time shift Comanche and I'll just name this social Twitter social Instagram

04:39.830 --> 04:43.480
social Google Plus

04:45.980 --> 04:48.720
social Facebook.

04:49.130 --> 04:55.580
And now I can select a circle and these other social icons you see sometimes and actually didn't put

04:55.580 --> 04:57.140
this in the same frame as the circle.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.200
Sometimes it's a little bit weird like that.

04:59.210 --> 05:02.740
So we want to drag this back down where the circle is.

05:03.060 --> 05:08.480
I'm going to hold out command and select this circle as well and we'll just group everything by creating

05:08.480 --> 05:09.310
a component.

05:09.540 --> 05:13.590
And we're to call this the social component.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.580
Now again we're going to hold down option and copy this and then all right click and move this to the

05:19.580 --> 05:20.750
components page.

05:21.050 --> 05:24.170
And now we have this child component.

05:24.170 --> 05:32.540
This is where we want to start off with the Google Plus icon that will hold down option three more times

05:34.100 --> 05:35.710
and copy this.

05:36.500 --> 05:44.140
And this one we want to be Facebook here we want it to be Instagram.

05:44.570 --> 05:49.700
And here we have this b Twitter.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.570
So we've done a good job already.

05:52.580 --> 05:57.320
But you can still see this is quite large compared to the circle.

05:57.550 --> 06:03.470
So let's right click on one of these and we'll go to the master component and just jumping inside of

06:03.470 --> 06:04.580
here.

06:05.300 --> 06:13.460
I'm going to hide each one and just go ahead and resize some of these things using this scale tool might

06:13.460 --> 06:16.430
help something like that I think will look good.

06:16.440 --> 06:22.010
Let's center that in the our board is Google Plus.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.980
Bring that down a little bit more.

06:27.560 --> 06:33.880
Instagram skill add a little something like this and same thing with Twitter

06:42.930 --> 06:51.040
center that we can jump back into our pages or page one and see how that all looks.

06:51.450 --> 06:57.610
And one thing I forgot to do I'm going to jump back into components is unhide the rest of these.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.680
Jump back in here.

06:59.910 --> 07:04.040
And that looks far more balanced.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.850
Now the last thing I want to do is add some text here to leave a review

07:12.270 --> 07:17.680
and now we want to center all of these things on the watch when I click to drag a drag handle to select

07:17.680 --> 07:20.580
everything I'm actually dragging these things behind.

07:20.590 --> 07:25.300
So this is where the lock layers will come in really handy these two layers right here.

07:25.300 --> 07:31.120
I want to lock now I can click and drag to select everything here except for these circles.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.710
Hold down shift and just click to de-select those.

07:35.020 --> 07:43.030
And now I can align horizontal centers here and I'll align everything here to the frame and also the

07:43.030 --> 07:44.940
center of the frame right here.

07:48.820 --> 07:58.660
Now I can start to align some of these items so I could just choose to add 10 pixels between each of

07:58.660 --> 08:00.050
these icons.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.030
But then right next to each other.

08:02.050 --> 08:04.610
Hold down shift and the right arrow key.

08:05.230 --> 08:10.710
But this next to G shift right arrow key.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.000
All right.

08:12.550 --> 08:23.320
So now let's center this with the overlay and let's put a nice 20 pixels in between there and zero pixels

08:23.320 --> 08:24.150
in between here

08:28.200 --> 08:30.300
and one to three That's 20 pixels.

08:30.300 --> 08:35.550
I'm going hold down shift and one more I'm going to have that 30 pixels here and then down here I'm

08:35.550 --> 08:40.980
going to add 30 pixels here.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.530
And 10 pixels right here.

08:47.250 --> 08:52.960
And when you're asking someone to leave a review here you want this all to be unfilled.

08:53.220 --> 09:01.630
So because this is a component I can choose this first store to hide this field layer.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.320
We're going to also hide this star.

09:05.430 --> 09:08.940
Same thing here same thing here

09:12.380 --> 09:17.920
and now it's blank and ready for them to leave a review.

09:17.930 --> 09:21.060
Last thing I want to do is resize this.

09:21.110 --> 09:26.530
So I want this to also have 30 pixels between the bottom of this pop up window.

09:26.810 --> 09:30.670
And the bottom of these stars so we can see is 26 pixels right here.

09:30.890 --> 09:37.410
So I guess I can just hold down command to resize and set of move and I'll tap this down or one two

09:37.410 --> 09:42.550
three four and we have a nice 30 pixels here and 30 pixels here.

09:42.890 --> 09:46.940
I'll move the shadow to be centered again.

09:46.940 --> 09:50.240
And now I can select everything here.

09:50.240 --> 09:57.080
Hit Comanche to group it and just make sure that this is centered with the frame that it's inside.

09:57.170 --> 10:04.160
The last thing I want to do is add an x ray here so I'll just quickly draw one.

10:04.680 --> 10:10.840
We'll have this two pixels here have this rounded.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.150
And now I'll select this line click command see Command V and quickly rotate.

10:17.780 --> 10:22.190
And for some reason when you rotate it's rotating on this left axis which is a little bit weird but

10:22.190 --> 10:26.070
I can just nudge this using the arrow keys to make it straight.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.770
I just noticed that when I was working with lions they behave a little bit unpredictably but now that

10:30.770 --> 10:39.830
I have this I can click on this union selection and now I have one nice fill all scroll out and I want

10:39.830 --> 10:49.730
to rotate this to 45 degrees and that I can go into object and flatten this selection and change this

10:49.730 --> 10:58.120
to be a nice even size will do 10 pixel by pixel and we'll just make this we hold down shift and nudge

10:58.130 --> 11:04.470
this left once and right once it will just sit 10 pixels away from the edge there.

11:05.030 --> 11:08.590
So now we have a nice pop up menu says you did it.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.730
They can leave a review let their friends know or tap this X and jump back into the recipe.

11:13.730 --> 11:19.080
Now I'm going to hit 0 to zoom out 100 percent see how that looks and it looks really good to me.

11:19.100 --> 11:24.580
But sometimes you have some artifacts there's this edge right here that looks like this.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.750
The edge of this isn't hitting the top even though it is.

11:28.160 --> 11:34.880
So sometimes if you get that it doesn't hurt to grab this shape inside of here and just move it up past

11:34.940 --> 11:40.040
the box just to make sure that you have everything filled inside up here.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.810
So this is how you illustrate an overlay here.

11:42.830 --> 11:46.910
You have to duplicate the image and then place some objects above this.
