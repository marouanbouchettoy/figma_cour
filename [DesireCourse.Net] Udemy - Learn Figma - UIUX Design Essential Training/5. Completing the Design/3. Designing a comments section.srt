1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,760
Now that we have the overlay designed and designed the comments section inside of the recipe details

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,550
screen here so you can feel free to design this on your own and match this with what I am doing.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,020
And if you want to do that just pause this video and crank away at the design and then you can resume

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,130
this video and see how it closely matches with what I'm talking about here.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,220
But if you want to follow along feel free to do so as well.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,200
So let's scroll down here we're going to jump into the recipe details frame right here.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,130
We can scroll down here and we want to comment section so I know that I can copy something like this.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,580
I'm going to just copy this down.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,870
I'm going to name this comments.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,060
And we know we don't want this same component here.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
So I don't want to ruin this component I can right click and detach.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Instance.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,040
So now this is no longer a component.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,530
It's not related to this master component.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,380
And I can hold down shift command G and I can delete this vector image and place in a comment image

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,990
so if I go into my components panel here you can see that I've already created some icons here is a

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:15,350
component so I can click and drag this into my art board here and now go back into layers.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,990
I only want this comment I Konst I'm going to hide these two.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
And I have that comment.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,620
And you can do this a number of ways but I'm just going to delete this icon here.

21
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,840
I'm going to use this child component and bring this inside of here and you can see that I want this

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,000
to match the same exact design as in this art board to the left of it here.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,110
But the color needs to change so there's sometimes there are exceptions to your design.

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,640
Just for one time instances and that's where child components really come in handy with overrides.

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,400
So I can double click on this layer here and I can create this to be white.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,400
And if you see when I double click inside of here there's this override symbol that's telling me I'm

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,190
overwriting the feel and I can always reset that to the master component if I want or just change this

28
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,030
and override it.

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,340
Just this one time.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:23,290
So now I'm going to bring that inside of my circle and I can create this as its own component or a master

31
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,320
component as well and reuse through out other areas if I'd like.

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:36,800
So now I'm going to hit the keyboard shortcut and just a 46 by 46 pixel Avatar.

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,220
And here I'm going to hit the T key and just add some text real quick so I'm going to add Tom Kline.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,860
He's a user of our app

35
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:58,230
and I'm going to make this 13 pixels here and just regular and if I want to match this color of this

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,840
font I can do it a few ways but I'm just going to quickly use this eyedropper tool and select something

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,910
here.

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,670
And you can see that I got barely off where I wanted to select.

39
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,020
So there we go.

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:18,010
And I can see this prime rib roast was amazing.

41
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,330
And it is all caps because under my advanced menu I have that transform control on what I'm going to

42
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,880
toggle this off and maybe I want to have this italics as well.

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:51,810
And the date that he commented was 7 dot 0 1 dot 2017 and I'm going to have this medium just like that.

44
00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:05,060
Now I can quickly set some sizes here just to align this with the base of this.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,770
And one two three four five just nudge this around to your liking.

46
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,090
And this is 26 pixels one two three four five six.

47
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,310
We have that 20 pixels now 10 pixels 10 pixels.

48
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,950
So that's looking pretty good.

49
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:30,120
And now I can click on the circle I'm going to fill this with an image and I can click on choose image

50
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,520
and I have a few other avatar images.

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm going to click on Avatar to.

52
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,510
And this is starting to look really good so maybe I'll just say this is a component itself.

53
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,200
So I'm going to click Create component and now this is a master component.

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,330
And if I click inside of here I can use this component frame to resize around and you can see that it's

55
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,750
doing some weird stuff.

56
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,110
So I'm going to hit Monsey.

57
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,570
I'm going to set some constraints in this component just real quick so I know that this is always going

58
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,140
to be constrained to the left and the top this is also in fact all of these are going to be constrained

59
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:16,320
to the left top and then this one here I can constrain this to the left and right.

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,630
So it grows as I grow this frame here.

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,800
So I'm going to hit the edge of this at 20 and you can see this is now behaving the way I want it.

62
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,740
And now I can hold down option on this component create a child component here and I can override the

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,590
text here.

64
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,540
Name this Sally Parker when you see what it did here I had the text aligned at the center so I can go

65
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,620
to the master component here and say I want this to align to the left actually.

66
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,300
And that changes automatically

67
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,500
and now I notice that this text here is running into this text.

68
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,690
So I probably want to add more spacing here so I can hold down shift and maybe I'll do something like

69
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,270
that.

70
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:08,220
I'm going to fix my spelling here and I'm going to just type in a comment for Charlie Parker.

71
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,120
OK.

72
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,030
So this one's a little bit lengthier but we can see that everything adjusted the right way and it looks

73
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,570
really good.

74
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,210
And lastly we can do a feel override as well so I can click on this image and choose a new image.

75
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,150
I'm going to choose Avatar 3 under our assets folder and go ahead and change that.

76
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,980
And even though this is a master component if I ever want to change this text here it should be rubato

77
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,260
medium black.

78
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,110
Anything else I can change that very easily.

79
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:45,760
In fact a good example of this if I move this down is I know that I want a five star rating system inside

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,410
of here.

81
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,370
And we know we already have that inside of our components so I'm going to click under components here

82
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,310
go to my five star system and I can drag this inside of this component actually.

83
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,390
So now that's dragged inside of there.

84
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,140
I'm going to move the rest of these guys down holding down shift and you can see how everything is just

85
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,680
moving in place and to bring that to the top here.

86
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,180
And I want this to be a little bit smaller actually.

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,500
And I can do a scale override on this component as well so if I I'd use the scale tool here down at

88
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:28,140
the bottom I can hold down shift to constrain my sizes and I want it to be maybe 10 pixels tall something

89
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,680
like that a little bit smaller.

90
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,520
And now I'll just adjust the rest of these to be 10 pixels or five.

91
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,660
One two three four five five pixels from the stars and I'm going to move this up here to just almost

92
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,690
hit this.

93
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,290
And very quickly you have your comments in here.

94
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,860
Now the last piece I'm going to create is a little type your comment here widget down here so I'm going

95
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,780
to hit R for rectangle.

96
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,450
Draw a rectangle here that is 40 to 45 pixels here.

97
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,810
And remember we already created a user persona for this design and that was Harry Truman.

98
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,590
So I can click this avatar here and hold down option.

99
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,350
I'm just going to copy this down here and reuse this.

100
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,870
And here maybe I want the avatar to be 32 pixels.

101
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,610
Going to line this to the left it at 20 pixels here.

102
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,970
And add some text here type your comments here.

103
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,290
Now I can reuse the same icon that we used previously.

104
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:49,620
I'm going to go into my layers panel and hide the rest of these.

105
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,990
So that's looking good and I'll sit that 20 pixels from the right here.

106
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,230
The last thing I want to do is create a White feel and instead of a stroke if we add a stroke here you

107
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,670
see that you have strokes round the edges.

108
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,820
I don't want that.

109
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,530
So I can show you how to add just a top and bottom strokes here if we go under effects and drop shadow

110
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,630
we can actually add a 1 pixel drop shadow that has a zero pixel blur.

111
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,970
And that shows up is a stroke or a line.

112
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm going to make that 10 pixel opacity.

113
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,130
So it's pretty light and I can just create a new one here and I'll do the same thing except negative

114
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:40,370
one 10 percent opacity zero pixel blur and you can see we have a top and bottom line here.

115
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,860
Now I'm going to select all of this create a new component and when I do that I'm just going to make

116
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,310
sure that everything's pinned to the top left how it should be here.

117
00:09:52,310 --> 00:10:00,300
This should be pinned to the center and well to the wall to the left here and also to the center down

118
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,430
here.

119
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,770
And this could be pinned to the right center.

120
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:20,120
And now I'll just stretch this something like this and change the opacity to 20 percent.

121
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,010
And the last thing you want to do is resize our frame so we're in a click on the frame here.

122
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,630
Come down here and just resize this.

123
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm going to hold down command to zoom in.

124
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,510
And now if I hold down option I can see that this is 36 pixels from the base of this.

125
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,100
So again one two three four five six holding down command and the arrow keys.

126
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,770
And then if I hold down Shift one to three that will move at ten pixels three times.

127
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,080
So you have a nice snug component in our frame also we can try resizing as we see that everything looks

128
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,610
really good.

129
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,120
And I'm going to pin this to the left and right.

130
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,730
So now let me resize it.

131
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,370
It kind of breaks down here.

132
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,010
Looking really good.

133
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,370
Same thing with these components just really quickly top left.

134
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,300
These are all top left left right.

135
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,490
So this is looking good.

136
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,160
I can resize this now.

137
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,990
It's looking really decent.

138
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,620
And then these guys we want just to be centered top center.

139
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,520
There we go.

140
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,580
We can move these around.

141
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,720
We're just playing with some spacing now just to get things looking good.

142
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,330
I haven't had an exact spacing convention in here mainly because I just wanted to use this time to teach

143
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,960
you the actual tools and later going to go in and fix a lot of the spacing.

144
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,730
While we're inside here we have some alignment issues for some of these things.

145
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,230
I'm just going to select all of them and align horizontal centers and our design is starting to look

146
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,720
really clean here.

147
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,620
We did change the text here to blue and we didn't change those here.

148
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:18,070
So again option command see then we can select these layers an option command V and paste those layers

149
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,970
in.

150
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:28,100
It's going to clean up some things make this all caps here and this is looking really really good.
