WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:05.760
Now that we have the overlay designed and designed the comments section inside of the recipe details

00:05.760 --> 00:11.550
screen here so you can feel free to design this on your own and match this with what I am doing.

00:11.610 --> 00:16.020
And if you want to do that just pause this video and crank away at the design and then you can resume

00:16.020 --> 00:20.130
this video and see how it closely matches with what I'm talking about here.

00:20.370 --> 00:23.220
But if you want to follow along feel free to do so as well.

00:23.550 --> 00:28.200
So let's scroll down here we're going to jump into the recipe details frame right here.

00:28.200 --> 00:34.130
We can scroll down here and we want to comment section so I know that I can copy something like this.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.580
I'm going to just copy this down.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.870
I'm going to name this comments.

00:40.650 --> 00:44.060
And we know we don't want this same component here.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.360
So I don't want to ruin this component I can right click and detach.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
Instance.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.040
So now this is no longer a component.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.530
It's not related to this master component.

00:53.710 --> 01:01.380
And I can hold down shift command G and I can delete this vector image and place in a comment image

01:03.460 --> 01:07.990
so if I go into my components panel here you can see that I've already created some icons here is a

01:07.990 --> 01:15.350
component so I can click and drag this into my art board here and now go back into layers.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.990
I only want this comment I Konst I'm going to hide these two.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.880
And I have that comment.

01:21.070 --> 01:25.620
And you can do this a number of ways but I'm just going to delete this icon here.

01:25.690 --> 01:31.840
I'm going to use this child component and bring this inside of here and you can see that I want this

01:31.840 --> 01:39.000
to match the same exact design as in this art board to the left of it here.

01:39.640 --> 01:44.110
But the color needs to change so there's sometimes there are exceptions to your design.

01:44.110 --> 01:50.640
Just for one time instances and that's where child components really come in handy with overrides.

01:50.680 --> 01:57.400
So I can double click on this layer here and I can create this to be white.

01:57.400 --> 02:03.400
And if you see when I double click inside of here there's this override symbol that's telling me I'm

02:03.430 --> 02:09.190
overwriting the feel and I can always reset that to the master component if I want or just change this

02:09.250 --> 02:10.030
and override it.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.340
Just this one time.

02:13.510 --> 02:23.290
So now I'm going to bring that inside of my circle and I can create this as its own component or a master

02:23.290 --> 02:28.320
component as well and reuse through out other areas if I'd like.

02:28.330 --> 02:36.800
So now I'm going to hit the keyboard shortcut and just a 46 by 46 pixel Avatar.

02:37.150 --> 02:43.220
And here I'm going to hit the T key and just add some text real quick so I'm going to add Tom Kline.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.860
He's a user of our app

02:49.890 --> 02:58.230
and I'm going to make this 13 pixels here and just regular and if I want to match this color of this

02:58.230 --> 03:03.840
font I can do it a few ways but I'm just going to quickly use this eyedropper tool and select something

03:03.840 --> 03:04.910
here.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.670
And you can see that I got barely off where I wanted to select.

03:08.670 --> 03:10.020
So there we go.

03:10.650 --> 03:18.010
And I can see this prime rib roast was amazing.

03:19.110 --> 03:24.330
And it is all caps because under my advanced menu I have that transform control on what I'm going to

03:24.330 --> 03:29.880
toggle this off and maybe I want to have this italics as well.

03:35.060 --> 03:51.810
And the date that he commented was 7 dot 0 1 dot 2017 and I'm going to have this medium just like that.

03:51.890 --> 04:05.060
Now I can quickly set some sizes here just to align this with the base of this.

04:05.880 --> 04:12.770
And one two three four five just nudge this around to your liking.

04:13.580 --> 04:17.090
And this is 26 pixels one two three four five six.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.310
We have that 20 pixels now 10 pixels 10 pixels.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.950
So that's looking pretty good.

04:23.130 --> 04:30.120
And now I can click on the circle I'm going to fill this with an image and I can click on choose image

04:30.570 --> 04:32.520
and I have a few other avatar images.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.970
I'm going to click on Avatar to.

04:37.530 --> 04:41.510
And this is starting to look really good so maybe I'll just say this is a component itself.

04:41.790 --> 04:45.200
So I'm going to click Create component and now this is a master component.

04:45.390 --> 04:51.330
And if I click inside of here I can use this component frame to resize around and you can see that it's

04:51.330 --> 04:52.750
doing some weird stuff.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.110
So I'm going to hit Monsey.

04:55.860 --> 05:00.570
I'm going to set some constraints in this component just real quick so I know that this is always going

05:00.570 --> 05:07.140
to be constrained to the left and the top this is also in fact all of these are going to be constrained

05:07.650 --> 05:16.320
to the left top and then this one here I can constrain this to the left and right.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.630
So it grows as I grow this frame here.

05:20.040 --> 05:25.800
So I'm going to hit the edge of this at 20 and you can see this is now behaving the way I want it.

05:26.130 --> 05:31.740
And now I can hold down option on this component create a child component here and I can override the

05:31.740 --> 05:32.590
text here.

05:32.700 --> 05:39.540
Name this Sally Parker when you see what it did here I had the text aligned at the center so I can go

05:39.540 --> 05:42.620
to the master component here and say I want this to align to the left actually.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.300
And that changes automatically

05:47.950 --> 05:52.500
and now I notice that this text here is running into this text.

05:52.660 --> 05:58.690
So I probably want to add more spacing here so I can hold down shift and maybe I'll do something like

05:58.690 --> 06:00.270
that.

06:00.750 --> 06:08.220
I'm going to fix my spelling here and I'm going to just type in a comment for Charlie Parker.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.120
OK.

06:09.130 --> 06:16.030
So this one's a little bit lengthier but we can see that everything adjusted the right way and it looks

06:16.030 --> 06:16.570
really good.

06:16.570 --> 06:22.210
And lastly we can do a feel override as well so I can click on this image and choose a new image.

06:22.210 --> 06:28.150
I'm going to choose Avatar 3 under our assets folder and go ahead and change that.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.980
And even though this is a master component if I ever want to change this text here it should be rubato

06:33.370 --> 06:35.260
medium black.

06:35.390 --> 06:38.110
Anything else I can change that very easily.

06:38.140 --> 06:45.760
In fact a good example of this if I move this down is I know that I want a five star rating system inside

06:45.760 --> 06:46.410
of here.

06:46.870 --> 06:51.370
And we know we already have that inside of our components so I'm going to click under components here

06:51.830 --> 06:57.310
go to my five star system and I can drag this inside of this component actually.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.390
So now that's dragged inside of there.

06:59.410 --> 07:05.140
I'm going to move the rest of these guys down holding down shift and you can see how everything is just

07:05.140 --> 07:10.680
moving in place and to bring that to the top here.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.180
And I want this to be a little bit smaller actually.

07:13.200 --> 07:19.500
And I can do a scale override on this component as well so if I I'd use the scale tool here down at

07:19.500 --> 07:28.140
the bottom I can hold down shift to constrain my sizes and I want it to be maybe 10 pixels tall something

07:28.140 --> 07:29.680
like that a little bit smaller.

07:30.030 --> 07:35.520
And now I'll just adjust the rest of these to be 10 pixels or five.

07:35.520 --> 07:42.660
One two three four five five pixels from the stars and I'm going to move this up here to just almost

07:42.660 --> 07:43.690
hit this.

07:43.890 --> 07:47.290
And very quickly you have your comments in here.

07:47.430 --> 07:52.860
Now the last piece I'm going to create is a little type your comment here widget down here so I'm going

07:52.860 --> 07:54.780
to hit R for rectangle.

07:54.780 --> 08:01.450
Draw a rectangle here that is 40 to 45 pixels here.

08:01.860 --> 08:06.810
And remember we already created a user persona for this design and that was Harry Truman.

08:06.930 --> 08:10.590
So I can click this avatar here and hold down option.

08:10.590 --> 08:14.350
I'm just going to copy this down here and reuse this.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.870
And here maybe I want the avatar to be 32 pixels.

08:20.330 --> 08:25.610
Going to line this to the left it at 20 pixels here.

08:29.910 --> 08:35.970
And add some text here type your comments here.

08:39.210 --> 08:43.290
Now I can reuse the same icon that we used previously.

08:43.290 --> 08:49.620
I'm going to go into my layers panel and hide the rest of these.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.990
So that's looking good and I'll sit that 20 pixels from the right here.

08:54.430 --> 09:01.230
The last thing I want to do is create a White feel and instead of a stroke if we add a stroke here you

09:01.230 --> 09:02.670
see that you have strokes round the edges.

09:02.670 --> 09:03.820
I don't want that.

09:04.020 --> 09:10.530
So I can show you how to add just a top and bottom strokes here if we go under effects and drop shadow

09:11.100 --> 09:17.630
we can actually add a 1 pixel drop shadow that has a zero pixel blur.

09:17.820 --> 09:20.970
And that shows up is a stroke or a line.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.340
I'm going to make that 10 pixel opacity.

09:23.340 --> 09:29.130
So it's pretty light and I can just create a new one here and I'll do the same thing except negative

09:29.130 --> 09:40.370
one 10 percent opacity zero pixel blur and you can see we have a top and bottom line here.

09:40.410 --> 09:46.860
Now I'm going to select all of this create a new component and when I do that I'm just going to make

09:46.860 --> 09:52.310
sure that everything's pinned to the top left how it should be here.

09:52.310 --> 10:00.300
This should be pinned to the center and well to the wall to the left here and also to the center down

10:00.300 --> 10:01.430
here.

10:02.730 --> 10:07.770
And this could be pinned to the right center.

10:10.390 --> 10:20.120
And now I'll just stretch this something like this and change the opacity to 20 percent.

10:20.670 --> 10:26.010
And the last thing you want to do is resize our frame so we're in a click on the frame here.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.630
Come down here and just resize this.

10:29.010 --> 10:31.860
I'm going to hold down command to zoom in.

10:31.860 --> 10:36.510
And now if I hold down option I can see that this is 36 pixels from the base of this.

10:36.840 --> 10:42.100
So again one two three four five six holding down command and the arrow keys.

10:42.180 --> 10:47.770
And then if I hold down Shift one to three that will move at ten pixels three times.

10:47.880 --> 10:55.080
So you have a nice snug component in our frame also we can try resizing as we see that everything looks

10:55.080 --> 10:56.610
really good.

10:58.050 --> 11:01.120
And I'm going to pin this to the left and right.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.730
So now let me resize it.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.370
It kind of breaks down here.

11:04.660 --> 11:09.010
Looking really good.

11:09.240 --> 11:14.370
Same thing with these components just really quickly top left.

11:14.490 --> 11:18.300
These are all top left left right.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.490
So this is looking good.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.160
I can resize this now.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.990
It's looking really decent.

11:24.990 --> 11:28.620
And then these guys we want just to be centered top center.

11:28.620 --> 11:34.520
There we go.

11:34.710 --> 11:38.580
We can move these around.

11:38.750 --> 11:42.720
We're just playing with some spacing now just to get things looking good.

11:42.730 --> 11:49.330
I haven't had an exact spacing convention in here mainly because I just wanted to use this time to teach

11:49.330 --> 11:53.960
you the actual tools and later going to go in and fix a lot of the spacing.

11:54.970 --> 11:59.730
While we're inside here we have some alignment issues for some of these things.

11:59.740 --> 12:05.230
I'm just going to select all of them and align horizontal centers and our design is starting to look

12:05.230 --> 12:06.720
really clean here.

12:06.940 --> 12:10.620
We did change the text here to blue and we didn't change those here.

12:10.780 --> 12:18.070
So again option command see then we can select these layers an option command V and paste those layers

12:18.070 --> 12:19.970
in.

12:20.400 --> 12:28.100
It's going to clean up some things make this all caps here and this is looking really really good.
