1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,880
Our design is looking really good and it's almost ready to prototype.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,750
But we're missing a few designs that I think are key to prototyping this correctly and that is when

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,790
we click on appetizers entrees or desserts we want to see how that toggle looks between this.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
So to do this we're going to create some more frames here and I'm just going to move these over here

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,000
to the right to make some room.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,300
And now I can hold down option and I'll copy this two times.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm going to rename this frame here it's named home but I'm just going to name this whole entrées.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,650
I'll name this one home.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,710
Appetisers.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:50,540
And this one home desserts sort of show you how these toggles work.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,510
Let's just go in here.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm going to zoom into all three of these and I'll show you how you can change each of these.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,970
So here we have the entrees all correct.

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,080
This is the appetizer screen.

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,970
So to change the state here I'm actually going to hold down command.

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,030
And if you hold down command it will drill inside of a group.

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,620
Right now I'm just selecting a group.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,160
But if you want to select elements inside of the group without double clicking them multiple times just

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,320
hold down command.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,260
I can click on entrées and with some quick shortcuts option commands see to copy the style Option Command

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,880
V to paste the style and then I'm going to select dessert.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,870
Do the same thing Option Command see Option Command B and paste this.

23
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,530
I'm just going to move this line now over here and stretch this out a bit.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:45,430
Holding down option to lock my left and right symmetry here.

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,830
So now we show appetisers the same thing with the zurr.

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,470
I'm just going to change this here so it's the same process command see Option Command B option command

27
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,500
see Option Command V and then I'll move this line over here to dessert.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,300
And just nudge this.

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,390
And now we have entrees appetizers desserts inside of our assets folder I have some text that we can

30
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,390
copy here for the appetizers and for the desserts.

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,730
So we have their recipe breadsticks text file for the appetizers and the recipe shortcake text file

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,830
for the dessert so we can quickly just select this command see to copy and we'll click in here a few

33
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,420
times and come in vi and we'll just call this breadsticks

34
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:47,890
and now with home desserts we're going to use this strawberry shortcake command C Manby and I'll just

35
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,960
name this here.

36
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,370
So now we have Prime Rib breadsticks strawberry shortcake.

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,530
Now I want to change the rating of these bread sticks here.

38
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,990
I'm actually going to give this four stars.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,770
So that's looking good.

40
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,000
And if I want to give this four stars as well I'm just going to delete that and to make life simpler

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,830
I'm just going to come and see.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,910
Click on this frame and command the

43
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,880
and I notice here that this isn't centered so we can quickly use the center icon and center our star

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,860
ratings and I'm going to hold down shift to select all of these I'm just going to nudge this down a

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,640
little bit so it's a little bit further away from this image.

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,510
Now for the images all we have to do is click inside of here quick choose image we have our assets folder

47
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,170
here or look for some breadsticks here.

48
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,440
And then the rest of the appetizer images we have to click on this x to get out of there and click on

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,840
this group double click a few times until we see this image thumbnail and we'll choose a new appetizer

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,580
or these caprice.

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,610
It's like mozzarella cheese with some tomatoes.

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,210
And the last appetizer here is going to be

53
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,300
hot wings.

54
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,460
Love the hot wings.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,040
So we have that set up and do the same thing over here.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,730
We know we want a strawberry shortcake.

57
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,960
Let's go into our desserts dessert right here strawberry shortcake.

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
And to the left

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,620
we can add

60
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,270
this chocolate cake and feel free to google your own images and place whatever you want in here.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,250
I'm just showing you the workflow for creating and duplicating some of these designs.

62
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,390
The last time I'm going to have is dessert ice cream cobbler.

63
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,370
OK so we have home on trees.

64
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,740
Home appetizers and home desserts.

65
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,120
We zoom out here.

66
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,450
We can see we have a nice complete design here and we're ready to finally wrap things up on the design.
