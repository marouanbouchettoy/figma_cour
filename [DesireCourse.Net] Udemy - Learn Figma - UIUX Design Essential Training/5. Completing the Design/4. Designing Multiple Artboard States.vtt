00:00.150 --> 00:03.880
Our design is looking really good and it's almost ready to prototype.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.750
But we're missing a few designs that I think are key to prototyping this correctly and that is when

00:09.750 --> 00:15.790
we click on appetizers entrees or desserts we want to see how that toggle looks between this.

00:15.870 --> 00:20.220
So to do this we're going to create some more frames here and I'm just going to move these over here

00:20.220 --> 00:23.000
to the right to make some room.

00:23.430 --> 00:28.300
And now I can hold down option and I'll copy this two times.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.800
I'm going to rename this frame here it's named home but I'm just going to name this whole entrées.

00:35.190 --> 00:38.650
I'll name this one home.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.710
Appetisers.

00:41.580 --> 00:50.540
And this one home desserts sort of show you how these toggles work.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.510
Let's just go in here.

00:51.510 --> 00:58.140
I'm going to zoom into all three of these and I'll show you how you can change each of these.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.970
So here we have the entrees all correct.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.080
This is the appetizer screen.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.970
So to change the state here I'm actually going to hold down command.

01:06.990 --> 01:10.030
And if you hold down command it will drill inside of a group.

01:10.030 --> 01:11.620
Right now I'm just selecting a group.

01:11.730 --> 01:17.160
But if you want to select elements inside of the group without double clicking them multiple times just

01:17.160 --> 01:18.320
hold down command.

01:18.540 --> 01:25.260
I can click on entrées and with some quick shortcuts option commands see to copy the style Option Command

01:25.260 --> 01:28.880
V to paste the style and then I'm going to select dessert.

01:28.890 --> 01:32.870
Do the same thing Option Command see Option Command B and paste this.

01:32.910 --> 01:37.530
I'm just going to move this line now over here and stretch this out a bit.

01:37.530 --> 01:45.430
Holding down option to lock my left and right symmetry here.

01:46.860 --> 01:49.830
So now we show appetisers the same thing with the zurr.

01:49.830 --> 01:55.470
I'm just going to change this here so it's the same process command see Option Command B option command

01:55.470 --> 02:01.500
see Option Command V and then I'll move this line over here to dessert.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.300
And just nudge this.

02:06.300 --> 02:12.390
And now we have entrees appetizers desserts inside of our assets folder I have some text that we can

02:12.390 --> 02:15.390
copy here for the appetizers and for the desserts.

02:15.420 --> 02:20.730
So we have their recipe breadsticks text file for the appetizers and the recipe shortcake text file

02:21.150 --> 02:28.830
for the dessert so we can quickly just select this command see to copy and we'll click in here a few

02:28.830 --> 02:33.420
times and come in vi and we'll just call this breadsticks

02:37.630 --> 02:47.890
and now with home desserts we're going to use this strawberry shortcake command C Manby and I'll just

02:47.890 --> 02:48.960
name this here.

02:52.790 --> 02:58.370
So now we have Prime Rib breadsticks strawberry shortcake.

02:58.370 --> 03:03.530
Now I want to change the rating of these bread sticks here.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.990
I'm actually going to give this four stars.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.770
So that's looking good.

03:11.810 --> 03:16.000
And if I want to give this four stars as well I'm just going to delete that and to make life simpler

03:16.010 --> 03:17.830
I'm just going to come and see.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.910
Click on this frame and command the

03:23.600 --> 03:28.880
and I notice here that this isn't centered so we can quickly use the center icon and center our star

03:28.880 --> 03:33.860
ratings and I'm going to hold down shift to select all of these I'm just going to nudge this down a

03:33.860 --> 03:38.640
little bit so it's a little bit further away from this image.

03:38.960 --> 03:44.510
Now for the images all we have to do is click inside of here quick choose image we have our assets folder

03:44.510 --> 03:48.170
here or look for some breadsticks here.

03:48.770 --> 03:54.440
And then the rest of the appetizer images we have to click on this x to get out of there and click on

03:54.440 --> 04:00.840
this group double click a few times until we see this image thumbnail and we'll choose a new appetizer

04:00.840 --> 04:02.580
or these caprice.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.610
It's like mozzarella cheese with some tomatoes.

04:07.100 --> 04:11.210
And the last appetizer here is going to be

04:14.470 --> 04:15.300
hot wings.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.460
Love the hot wings.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.040
So we have that set up and do the same thing over here.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.730
We know we want a strawberry shortcake.

04:24.780 --> 04:30.960
Let's go into our desserts dessert right here strawberry shortcake.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.800
And to the left

04:35.750 --> 04:36.620
we can add

04:41.620 --> 04:47.270
this chocolate cake and feel free to google your own images and place whatever you want in here.

04:47.500 --> 04:54.250
I'm just showing you the workflow for creating and duplicating some of these designs.

04:54.310 --> 05:02.390
The last time I'm going to have is dessert ice cream cobbler.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.370
OK so we have home on trees.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.740
Home appetizers and home desserts.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.120
We zoom out here.

05:09.510 --> 05:15.450
We can see we have a nice complete design here and we're ready to finally wrap things up on the design.
