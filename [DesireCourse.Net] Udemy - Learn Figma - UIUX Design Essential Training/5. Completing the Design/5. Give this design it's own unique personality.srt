00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,610
Now that we've designed all of the elements inside of each one of these frames I want to challenge you

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,400
to give this design your own personality.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,240
You can use your own colors your own fonts and try playing around with the icons the sizes and everything

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,230
else to make this app really your own.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,600
I'll also add some time on this design just adding a few minor elements here to really give it a nice

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,880
polish by using the skills that you learned in the previous video.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:35,970
You should be well-rounded and be able to adjust a lot of these designs here adjust the text and anything

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,870
else that you would like.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,380
One thing that I was interested in doing here is I was designing this is giving some of the shapes like

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,410
this a little bit more organic feel so I could double click into this for example and I can just tweak

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,370
this circle just a little bit to make it look kind of like a a catch up blob.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,720
So we can do something like that just to give it a little bit more personality.

13
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,160
And so try things like that and try different fonts.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,960
So for example I like the font Fat Frank so I can click on some of these text elements here and go into

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,990
the text just type in Fat Frank and everything changes here.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,230
Looks like I have some extra text inside of here so I'm just going to delete that and move this back.

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:30,840
And so already there some added personality here and I can Option Command see to copy this style and

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
even paste it crossed other elements here.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,270
So play with the corner radiuses here.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,480
Play with the sizes and when you're done with the design Feel free to add me as a collaborator.

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,470
You can use the email kilobit brain spin dot com to share your designs with me and I'm happy to comment

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,540
and give you advice along the way with your design.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,530
Also if you want to share any parts of your design whether it's on Twitter or Facebook Instagram just

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,050
use the hash tag Ficke my recipe and I'll be watching out for that hash tag and I can give you some

25
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,040
comments and feedback there.

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:10,430
OK so I've added some finishing touches here and I can walk you through what I've done.

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,790
I went and tweets the font here this was a handwritten font using the pencil tool so I just tweaked

28
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,320
the sizes to keep it more consistent.

29
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,030
And then I used the Fat Frank font here for some of the hetter texture the menu text.

30
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,030
I use that across the project here and I changed my paragraph text to be burial which is a font that

31
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,640
I really like.

32
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,190
And so it just gives it just a little bit more personality here.

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,210
It just looks a little bit more fun and we can come down here.

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,130
I play it a little bit with the line heights and I also made these circles just a little bit more organic

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,810
here and same thing here.

36
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,320
So it looks like just like a drop of catch up or something.

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,720
And lastly under the comments window I just created a light gray rectangle here to kind of divide the

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,670
comments section from the rest of this.

39
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:12,150
And I actually forgot the style of this fund here so I'm just going to copy and paste this here.

40
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,660
So now we have all of our art boards all designed and lined up here and we are ready to begin prototyping.
