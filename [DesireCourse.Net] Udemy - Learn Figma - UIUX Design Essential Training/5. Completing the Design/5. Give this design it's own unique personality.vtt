Now that we've designed all of the elements inside of each one of these frames I want to challenge you

00:05.610 --> 00:08.400
to give this design your own personality.

00:08.610 --> 00:15.240
You can use your own colors your own fonts and try playing around with the icons the sizes and everything

00:15.240 --> 00:19.230
else to make this app really your own.

00:19.230 --> 00:24.600
I'll also add some time on this design just adding a few minor elements here to really give it a nice

00:24.600 --> 00:28.880
polish by using the skills that you learned in the previous video.

00:28.950 --> 00:35.970
You should be well-rounded and be able to adjust a lot of these designs here adjust the text and anything

00:35.970 --> 00:37.870
else that you would like.

00:37.890 --> 00:43.380
One thing that I was interested in doing here is I was designing this is giving some of the shapes like

00:43.380 --> 00:49.410
this a little bit more organic feel so I could double click into this for example and I can just tweak

00:49.410 --> 00:55.370
this circle just a little bit to make it look kind of like a a catch up blob.

00:55.950 --> 00:59.720
So we can do something like that just to give it a little bit more personality.

00:59.930 --> 01:04.160
And so try things like that and try different fonts.

01:04.170 --> 01:12.960
So for example I like the font Fat Frank so I can click on some of these text elements here and go into

01:12.960 --> 01:16.990
the text just type in Fat Frank and everything changes here.

01:17.070 --> 01:22.230
Looks like I have some extra text inside of here so I'm just going to delete that and move this back.

01:22.430 --> 01:30.840
And so already there some added personality here and I can Option Command see to copy this style and

01:30.840 --> 01:33.840
even paste it crossed other elements here.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.270
So play with the corner radiuses here.

01:36.270 --> 01:41.480
Play with the sizes and when you're done with the design Feel free to add me as a collaborator.

01:41.730 --> 01:46.470
You can use the email kilobit brain spin dot com to share your designs with me and I'm happy to comment

01:46.980 --> 01:49.540
and give you advice along the way with your design.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.530
Also if you want to share any parts of your design whether it's on Twitter or Facebook Instagram just

01:55.530 --> 02:01.050
use the hash tag Ficke my recipe and I'll be watching out for that hash tag and I can give you some

02:01.050 --> 02:03.040
comments and feedback there.

02:04.870 --> 02:10.430
OK so I've added some finishing touches here and I can walk you through what I've done.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.790
I went and tweets the font here this was a handwritten font using the pencil tool so I just tweaked

02:15.790 --> 02:18.320
the sizes to keep it more consistent.

02:18.670 --> 02:24.030
And then I used the Fat Frank font here for some of the hetter texture the menu text.

02:24.130 --> 02:31.030
I use that across the project here and I changed my paragraph text to be burial which is a font that

02:31.030 --> 02:32.640
I really like.

02:32.830 --> 02:36.190
And so it just gives it just a little bit more personality here.

02:36.460 --> 02:41.210
It just looks a little bit more fun and we can come down here.

02:41.260 --> 02:48.130
I play it a little bit with the line heights and I also made these circles just a little bit more organic

02:48.130 --> 02:51.810
here and same thing here.

02:51.810 --> 02:55.320
So it looks like just like a drop of catch up or something.

02:55.840 --> 03:01.720
And lastly under the comments window I just created a light gray rectangle here to kind of divide the

03:01.720 --> 03:04.670
comments section from the rest of this.

03:04.930 --> 03:12.150
And I actually forgot the style of this fund here so I'm just going to copy and paste this here.

03:12.310 --> 03:19.660
So now we have all of our art boards all designed and lined up here and we are ready to begin prototyping.
