1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,870
Finally we are ready to prototype our design now prototyping is really easy and you can find the prototyping

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,170
tab here next to the Design tab.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,670
And once you click on this prototyping tab then you get this circle here to the right of every object

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,740
that you select that you can click and drag to link your boards up.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,620
So if we're starting off with the splash screen you want to go from the splash screen to the home entrées

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,410
screen here and I'm going to zoom in here so we can see just in a little bit more detail what I'm doing.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,850
And as you can see with these three screens we want to link these up by clicking on appetisers to jump

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,850
to this page.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,880
And entrées to jump to this page.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,610
But they're all inside one group.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,110
Well that's OK we could link the group to other art boards but that's not going to work in our case

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,010
so we can double click to drill into just this desert text here and we can drag this over to desert's

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,280
and we don't need to link up entrées because we're on the entrées page we can link up appetisers and

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,590
same thing here on trees goes here.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,040
Desert's goes here and same thing here on trees.

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,970
Appetisers So we already have those links up.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,320
Now we can select these menu items and link these up here.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,900
And looks like those are all correct.

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,880
And now we're going to run into a bit of a problem here.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,620
We have these hyperlinks here I created this all in one text box and this works OK and most design cases.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,840
But if you want to prototype this you can only prototype this one box.

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,760
So it's not going to work for us.

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,000
So we can jump back into design here.

24
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,600
And I'm just going to select this text here and do a command X to cut it.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,630
And now we'll just copy these elements down here.

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,190
I'll paste this in to the same thing.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,670
Cut down here.

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:13,290
Paste this and cut this last text and paste again.

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,180
These have to be individual text boxes just for the sake of prototyping.

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,360
So now I want these to be 30 pixels apart.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,510
And that looks good now.

32
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,370
So we can jump back into prototype mode.

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,610
And now I can jump into popular recipes is going to be this page here.

34
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,050
And we didn't design a saved recipes shopping list or setting screen.

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,660
But if you wanted to design some screens to kind of mock up this interaction you can do that and then

36
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,970
just link to your saved recipes after you design something like that.

37
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,420
So this will work for what we have so far.

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,360
And so this menu actually we want this to link back to the popular recipes as well kind of a slide back

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
and forth type of thing.

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,590
Now if the user clicks on this image we want that to link to the recipe details screen and maybe this

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,950
title to sort and link this to the recipe details as well.

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,600
And then as we're going down this list if the user clicks on this last step checking it off they're

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,540
going to get this screen saying you did it share with your friends and they can click on this x here

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,680
to jump back.

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,010
Or maybe this background image they can click on here and jump back as well.

46
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,260
So I think we have everything linked up and we can test it very quickly just to make sure.

47
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,280
So we have the start screen right here.

48
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,760
We can move it anywhere we want but we're going to leave this at the splash screen here and we'll just

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,500
go into present mode and let's see how well we've done.

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,920
We have the design chefe screen.

51
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,330
You can click anywhere to jump into our popular recipes.

52
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,560
And let's just see how this menu works here so we can click there or click back that toggle works great.

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,850
Or we can click on popular recipes here and we can toggle between appetizers entrees and desserts here.

54
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,800
So that's looking really good.

55
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,010
And I probably should have changed the timing because it doesn't take five hours for strawberry shortcake

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,200
but you can change that if you want.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,900
Now we have that all set up and you can see if I click here nothing happens because we don't have a

58
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,410
strawberry shortcake recipe.

59
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,460
We don't have a breadsticks recipe but we do have this prime rib roast so that's going to jump us into

60
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,130
this.

61
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,900
And you see how this is zoomed out to show us the entire board.

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,680
Well what we want to do is change this feel area to display it 100 percent always.

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,820
So now this behaves a little bit more like what you would see on the iPhone.

64
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,390
Now one thing I've noticed while prototyping and this is why prototyping is so helpful.

65
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:06,790
I don't have a way to jump back into that home screen so very quickly I can still jump into my prototyping

66
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,840
file and we can see down here we need an x icon.

67
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,220
So we're just going to zoom into these two boards.

68
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,950
I'll go back into design and I already have an X-ray here that I can use.

69
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,490
I'll just hold down option and bring this over here and just lay this in the center somewhere and I'm

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,300
going to make the field white and I probably want to make this a little bit bigger.

71
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,390
So 20 pixels by 20 pixels and that's looking good.

72
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,080
I think that'll be a nice X screen.

73
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:46,840
The last thing I'm going to do is just add a subtle drop shadow here of 50 pixel opacity and zero pixels

74
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,080
vertically.

75
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,000
So we have that nice x.

76
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,840
We can still jump into our prototyping present mode and we can see that we have that X now but if we

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:05,500
go back into our design and go into prototype you now I can choose to have this x come back over to

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:15,450
entrées jump back into my prototyping and now I can toggle back and forth between these.

79
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,750
So again as you prototype you'll see things like this where you may get stuck in the prototyping or

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,030
the interaction and you'll have to go back into your design add some buttons and then test again to

81
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,830
make sure that somebody can go through your design.

82
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,280
The last screen we have right here is we can check off this last step and we have this congratulations

83
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,880
you did it screen and we can click X to jump back into our prime rib roast.
