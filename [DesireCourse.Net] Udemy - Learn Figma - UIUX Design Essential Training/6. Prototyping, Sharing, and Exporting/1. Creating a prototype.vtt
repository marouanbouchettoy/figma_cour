00:00.090 --> 00:06.870
Finally we are ready to prototype our design now prototyping is really easy and you can find the prototyping

00:06.870 --> 00:09.170
tab here next to the Design tab.

00:09.420 --> 00:14.670
And once you click on this prototyping tab then you get this circle here to the right of every object

00:14.670 --> 00:18.740
that you select that you can click and drag to link your boards up.

00:19.140 --> 00:25.620
So if we're starting off with the splash screen you want to go from the splash screen to the home entrées

00:25.740 --> 00:32.410
screen here and I'm going to zoom in here so we can see just in a little bit more detail what I'm doing.

00:32.490 --> 00:38.850
And as you can see with these three screens we want to link these up by clicking on appetisers to jump

00:38.850 --> 00:39.850
to this page.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.880
And entrées to jump to this page.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.610
But they're all inside one group.

00:43.710 --> 00:49.110
Well that's OK we could link the group to other art boards but that's not going to work in our case

00:49.110 --> 00:56.010
so we can double click to drill into just this desert text here and we can drag this over to desert's

00:57.150 --> 01:02.280
and we don't need to link up entrées because we're on the entrées page we can link up appetisers and

01:02.280 --> 01:04.590
same thing here on trees goes here.

01:04.770 --> 01:11.040
Desert's goes here and same thing here on trees.

01:11.730 --> 01:15.970
Appetisers So we already have those links up.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.320
Now we can select these menu items and link these up here.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.900
And looks like those are all correct.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.880
And now we're going to run into a bit of a problem here.

01:32.880 --> 01:40.620
We have these hyperlinks here I created this all in one text box and this works OK and most design cases.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.840
But if you want to prototype this you can only prototype this one box.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.760
So it's not going to work for us.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.000
So we can jump back into design here.

01:48.330 --> 01:54.600
And I'm just going to select this text here and do a command X to cut it.

01:55.290 --> 01:59.630
And now we'll just copy these elements down here.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.190
I'll paste this in to the same thing.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.670
Cut down here.

02:06.070 --> 02:13.290
Paste this and cut this last text and paste again.

02:13.330 --> 02:18.180
These have to be individual text boxes just for the sake of prototyping.

02:18.790 --> 02:23.360
So now I want these to be 30 pixels apart.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.510
And that looks good now.

02:26.650 --> 02:29.370
So we can jump back into prototype mode.

02:31.540 --> 02:35.610
And now I can jump into popular recipes is going to be this page here.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.050
And we didn't design a saved recipes shopping list or setting screen.

02:40.330 --> 02:46.660
But if you wanted to design some screens to kind of mock up this interaction you can do that and then

02:46.660 --> 02:51.970
just link to your saved recipes after you design something like that.

02:52.060 --> 02:55.420
So this will work for what we have so far.

02:55.750 --> 03:01.360
And so this menu actually we want this to link back to the popular recipes as well kind of a slide back

03:01.360 --> 03:03.280
and forth type of thing.

03:03.970 --> 03:11.590
Now if the user clicks on this image we want that to link to the recipe details screen and maybe this

03:11.590 --> 03:14.950
title to sort and link this to the recipe details as well.

03:15.370 --> 03:22.600
And then as we're going down this list if the user clicks on this last step checking it off they're

03:22.600 --> 03:28.540
going to get this screen saying you did it share with your friends and they can click on this x here

03:28.540 --> 03:29.680
to jump back.

03:29.830 --> 03:35.010
Or maybe this background image they can click on here and jump back as well.

03:39.070 --> 03:44.260
So I think we have everything linked up and we can test it very quickly just to make sure.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.280
So we have the start screen right here.

03:46.280 --> 03:51.760
We can move it anywhere we want but we're going to leave this at the splash screen here and we'll just

03:51.760 --> 03:56.500
go into present mode and let's see how well we've done.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.920
We have the design chefe screen.

04:00.010 --> 04:03.330
You can click anywhere to jump into our popular recipes.

04:03.370 --> 04:09.560
And let's just see how this menu works here so we can click there or click back that toggle works great.

04:09.640 --> 04:16.850
Or we can click on popular recipes here and we can toggle between appetizers entrees and desserts here.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.800
So that's looking really good.

04:19.420 --> 04:24.010
And I probably should have changed the timing because it doesn't take five hours for strawberry shortcake

04:24.040 --> 04:26.200
but you can change that if you want.

04:26.920 --> 04:31.900
Now we have that all set up and you can see if I click here nothing happens because we don't have a

04:31.900 --> 04:34.410
strawberry shortcake recipe.

04:34.450 --> 04:39.460
We don't have a breadsticks recipe but we do have this prime rib roast so that's going to jump us into

04:39.460 --> 04:40.130
this.

04:40.210 --> 04:43.900
And you see how this is zoomed out to show us the entire board.

04:44.080 --> 04:50.680
Well what we want to do is change this feel area to display it 100 percent always.

04:50.680 --> 04:54.820
So now this behaves a little bit more like what you would see on the iPhone.

04:54.820 --> 04:58.390
Now one thing I've noticed while prototyping and this is why prototyping is so helpful.

04:58.390 --> 05:06.790
I don't have a way to jump back into that home screen so very quickly I can still jump into my prototyping

05:06.790 --> 05:11.840
file and we can see down here we need an x icon.

05:12.070 --> 05:15.220
So we're just going to zoom into these two boards.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.950
I'll go back into design and I already have an X-ray here that I can use.

05:18.950 --> 05:24.490
I'll just hold down option and bring this over here and just lay this in the center somewhere and I'm

05:24.490 --> 05:29.300
going to make the field white and I probably want to make this a little bit bigger.

05:29.740 --> 05:34.390
So 20 pixels by 20 pixels and that's looking good.

05:34.390 --> 05:37.080
I think that'll be a nice X screen.

05:37.120 --> 05:46.840
The last thing I'm going to do is just add a subtle drop shadow here of 50 pixel opacity and zero pixels

05:47.320 --> 05:48.080
vertically.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.000
So we have that nice x.

05:50.170 --> 05:55.840
We can still jump into our prototyping present mode and we can see that we have that X now but if we

05:55.840 --> 06:05.500
go back into our design and go into prototype you now I can choose to have this x come back over to

06:05.500 --> 06:15.450
entrées jump back into my prototyping and now I can toggle back and forth between these.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.750
So again as you prototype you'll see things like this where you may get stuck in the prototyping or

06:20.760 --> 06:27.030
the interaction and you'll have to go back into your design add some buttons and then test again to

06:27.030 --> 06:31.830
make sure that somebody can go through your design.

06:31.830 --> 06:38.280
The last screen we have right here is we can check off this last step and we have this congratulations

06:38.290 --> 06:42.880
you did it screen and we can click X to jump back into our prime rib roast.
