00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,240
Now that we have everything prototyped here when we're in prototype mode we can click on share a prototype

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,040
right here and we can either add people's emails to share this to them or we can click copy link here.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,420
So now that the link is copied to the clipboard we can text or email that link to anybody that we'd

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,740
like.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,130
Ok and now that I have this link e-mailed to me I can tap on the link here.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,140
It'll open this up in your browser.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,610
And once I sign into sigma I can play with this prototype here directly through this browser.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:40,620
So if I click on an appetizer dessert entrees I can click on the menu and you can really see this live

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,030
on your device which is really helpful.
