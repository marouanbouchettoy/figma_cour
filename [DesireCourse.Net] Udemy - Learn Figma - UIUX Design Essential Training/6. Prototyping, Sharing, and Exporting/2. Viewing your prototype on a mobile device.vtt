Now that we have everything prototyped here when we're in prototype mode we can click on share a prototype

00:06.240 --> 00:13.040
right here and we can either add people's emails to share this to them or we can click copy link here.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.420
So now that the link is copied to the clipboard we can text or email that link to anybody that we'd

00:18.420 --> 00:19.740
like.

00:20.490 --> 00:24.130
Ok and now that I have this link e-mailed to me I can tap on the link here.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.140
It'll open this up in your browser.

00:26.490 --> 00:32.610
And once I sign into sigma I can play with this prototype here directly through this browser.

00:32.610 --> 00:40.620
So if I click on an appetizer dessert entrees I can click on the menu and you can really see this live

00:40.620 --> 00:43.030
on your device which is really helpful.
