As you're designing your app Sometimes it's really helpful to see what these screens are going to look

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,580
like directly on your device and to do that has a nice app for Android and for iPhone.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,350
And it's called the Sigma mirror app.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,500
So just look in the Google Play store for Sigma mirror or look in the Apple App Store for fig mimir.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,740
And once you download this app you can sign in using your log in name and password and you'll be presented

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,710
with a screen that tells you to click on a frame on your desktop to see what it looks like on your phone.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,620
So here we have the home entrées frame.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,690
And when I click on this you can see that our iPhone updates showing us what this frame looks like directly

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,130
on the device.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,310
And one thing that's really nice about this is you can tweak your sizes you can move things around and

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,500
these things happen live directly on your device as well.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,870
So sometimes I like to design some icons that are quite large here and you don't know how large they're

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,280
going to be in relation to your device.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,350
And so it's nice to look at that and then do a quick resizing here to make the sizes relative to your

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,100
screen and make the tap area large enough so that you can't miss it.
