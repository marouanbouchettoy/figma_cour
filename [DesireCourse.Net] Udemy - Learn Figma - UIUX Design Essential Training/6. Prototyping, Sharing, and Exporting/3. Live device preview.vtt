As you're designing your app Sometimes it's really helpful to see what these screens are going to look

00:05.190 --> 00:11.580
like directly on your device and to do that has a nice app for Android and for iPhone.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.350
And it's called the Sigma mirror app.

00:13.350 --> 00:19.500
So just look in the Google Play store for Sigma mirror or look in the Apple App Store for fig mimir.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.740
And once you download this app you can sign in using your log in name and password and you'll be presented

00:25.740 --> 00:30.710
with a screen that tells you to click on a frame on your desktop to see what it looks like on your phone.

00:30.990 --> 00:34.620
So here we have the home entrÃ©es frame.

00:34.620 --> 00:39.690
And when I click on this you can see that our iPhone updates showing us what this frame looks like directly

00:39.690 --> 00:41.130
on the device.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.310
And one thing that's really nice about this is you can tweak your sizes you can move things around and

00:47.310 --> 00:51.500
these things happen live directly on your device as well.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.870
So sometimes I like to design some icons that are quite large here and you don't know how large they're

00:57.870 --> 01:00.280
going to be in relation to your device.

01:00.480 --> 01:07.350
And so it's nice to look at that and then do a quick resizing here to make the sizes relative to your

01:07.350 --> 01:11.100
screen and make the tap area large enough so that you can't miss it.
