Please share your designs with me I would love to give you feedback using the common tool here and help

00:06.420 --> 00:10.410
you out with your design if you have any questions at all after designing all of these.

00:10.410 --> 00:16.140
And after going through the video if you click this sure icon here you can share this with friends and

00:16.140 --> 00:19.060
colleagues in the design files that you want.

00:19.410 --> 00:25.090
Or if you'd like to share with me just type in Callebaut bit brain spin dot com here.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.890
And then you can choose for me to just view if you'd like.

00:27.930 --> 00:33.270
And if I have view access I still have the ability to comment and give you feedback without going in

00:33.270 --> 00:35.370
and messing up your design.

00:35.370 --> 00:40.860
I'm excited to see your design and to see the things that makes sense to you and what doesn't make sense

00:40.860 --> 00:41.550
to you.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.510
And I would love to help you out beyond this course.

00:44.820 --> 00:50.700
Now when you do click on the share icon you can share to multiple people this way or you can copy a

00:50.700 --> 00:57.990
link and share it through a text or e-mail and you can also embed this design directly inside of a blog.

00:58.020 --> 01:03.840
So if you enable public access here it will make it viewable by everybody and it will give you some

01:03.840 --> 01:08.730
code that you can embed inside of Wordpress or any other blog that you want to share.

01:08.730 --> 01:12.740
So when somebody logs into your web site they can see this design.

01:12.870 --> 01:17.370
And even as you update the design it will show on your blog as well.
