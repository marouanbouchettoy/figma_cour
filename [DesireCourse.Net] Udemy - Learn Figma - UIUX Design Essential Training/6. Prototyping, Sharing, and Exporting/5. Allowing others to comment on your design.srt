00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,630
Now if you Adamy collaborators using this share icon you can add them to only view or to edit the design

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,430
itself.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,940
But all collaborators they have access to this design all have the ability to comment.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,390
So if I click Show comments here you'll be able to interact with multiple collaborators by clicking

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,320
on a frame and just typing something like those breadsticks look yummy.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:36,830
And they have some basic emoticons that you can use and you just hit post and there's my comment if

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,260
there's any comments for feedback of somebody giving you feedback on color changes or padding.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,420
If you finished you can click this resolve button here and you can see that they're hidden in the list

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,390
of comments.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,170
You can toggle the results comments on and off here.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,330
And if you toggle them back on you can unresolved them if they need further editing.

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,410
Also any collaborators that you share with this project any time that you comment anything than I have

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,300
right here unable to receive e-mail notifications.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,850
So if I share this with anybody and they comment I'm going to get an e-mail that shows me what they

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,800
call him and I can click on the e-mail link and jump right into the frame that they're commenting on.
