Now if you Adamy collaborators using this share icon you can add them to only view or to edit the design

00:06.630 --> 00:07.430
itself.

00:07.710 --> 00:12.940
But all collaborators they have access to this design all have the ability to comment.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.390
So if I click Show comments here you'll be able to interact with multiple collaborators by clicking

00:18.390 --> 00:26.320
on a frame and just typing something like those breadsticks look yummy.

00:27.390 --> 00:36.830
And they have some basic emoticons that you can use and you just hit post and there's my comment if

00:36.830 --> 00:42.260
there's any comments for feedback of somebody giving you feedback on color changes or padding.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.420
If you finished you can click this resolve button here and you can see that they're hidden in the list

00:47.420 --> 00:48.390
of comments.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.170
You can toggle the results comments on and off here.

00:51.470 --> 00:57.330
And if you toggle them back on you can unresolved them if they need further editing.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.410
Also any collaborators that you share with this project any time that you comment anything than I have

01:03.410 --> 01:06.300
right here unable to receive e-mail notifications.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.850
So if I share this with anybody and they comment I'm going to get an e-mail that shows me what they

01:10.850 --> 01:15.800
call him and I can click on the e-mail link and jump right into the frame that they're commenting on.
