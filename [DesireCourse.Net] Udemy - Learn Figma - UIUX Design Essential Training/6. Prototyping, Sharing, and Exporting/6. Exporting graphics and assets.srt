1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,100
After you've finished with your design and you're testing out the prototype and everything looks really

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,300
good you probably want to export some of these assets for your developers to use.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,460
A good way to do this is to look at each screen.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,280
So we have this screen right here with the chef's icon and then some custom text here.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,070
So I'm going to just group all of this text.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm going to name this title chef's recipe and here I'm just going to name this icon chef's hat.

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,700
And you just want to make sure that all of your graphics are named correctly the name that you want

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,320
the file to export as.

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,200
And now if you click on this export button here we can see that there 0 0 0 selected designs.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,730
That's because if we want to use this we want to make these graphics exportable so we can click on this

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,910
plus icon here and we can choose to export this as PMG JPAC or SPG.

12
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,830
Now if we choose g we can export this at its exact pixel size.

13
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:12,400
Or if we want to add a two times or three times you can just keep on hitting this plus icon and it will

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,230
create some multiple sizes here.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,180
So we have a 2 x 3 x and if we want text appended to the filename.

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,600
That's what this is doing here so it's going to say Icahn's chef's hat at 2 x at 3 x so very quickly.

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm enabling these two to be exported one time to time three times.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,460
And let's go over here.

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,010
The same thing we want to make sure that these are named correctly so we can just name this timer name

20
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,650
this hard.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,730
Just really quickly you probably have different naming conventions.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,750
But just make it really simple for your developers to find what they want and you want to do this throughout

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,360
all of the designs here.

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,970
But let's just use these three so I can select all three of these and come down here I'm going to hit.

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,010
Plus it's exploiting those as one time two times three times right here.

26
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,370
So now I don't have to have anything selected because I've preset those to be exportable.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,820
I can click on this export now and it will tell me there's 15 graphics that are going to be exported.

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,640
And you see this is one time two times three times.

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:29,510
And this is giving me an error that the origin is not aligned to pixels but we can quickly click export.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:37,170
I'm going to just export this to my desktop and I'll create a new folder called assets

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,540
and hit save.

32
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,560
And now when I go into my assets folder under my desktop when I created these you can see the names

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,790
of these comments at 2 x at 3 x and so very easily I can see what these look like.

34
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,090
So this is three times two times in one time they are different sizes and you can pass these off to

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,320
your developer to use while they're developing the front end of this design.

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,940
Another thing you can do to export assets for your developers is just share this fig file with them

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,610
and they don't have to know how to design.

38
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,560
They just have to know how to grab these elements and even Mark some of these elements themselves as

39
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,120
exportable.

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,910
So for example if we click on this home on trace here and we go to the code section your developer can

41
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,970
still click on these icons they can name them whatever they want here and they can choose to export

42
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,280
these however they want to export these whatever is going to be the best format for them and they can

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,140
export these individually so if they click export button menu for example they can go into the same

44
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,170
folder and click save.

45
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,230
And if we jump back in to here we can see that those are also saved here.

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,180
So it's very easy to export these things out.

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,710
And in fact once you preset these elements if you ever change them in the future and click to re-export

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,860
it'll just overwrite over those existing images and create new fresh versions automatically.
