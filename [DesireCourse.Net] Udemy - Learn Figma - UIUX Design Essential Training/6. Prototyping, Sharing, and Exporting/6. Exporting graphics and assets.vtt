After you've finished with your design and you're testing out the prototype and everything looks really

00:05.100 --> 00:10.300
good you probably want to export some of these assets for your developers to use.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.460
A good way to do this is to look at each screen.

00:13.710 --> 00:19.280
So we have this screen right here with the chef's icon and then some custom text here.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.070
So I'm going to just group all of this text.

00:22.290 --> 00:37.980
I'm going to name this title chef's recipe and here I'm just going to name this icon chef's hat.

00:38.410 --> 00:42.700
And you just want to make sure that all of your graphics are named correctly the name that you want

00:42.700 --> 00:44.320
the file to export as.

00:44.380 --> 00:50.200
And now if you click on this export button here we can see that there 0 0 0 selected designs.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.730
That's because if we want to use this we want to make these graphics exportable so we can click on this

00:54.760 --> 01:00.910
plus icon here and we can choose to export this as PMG JPAC or SPG.

01:00.910 --> 01:05.830
Now if we choose g we can export this at its exact pixel size.

01:06.130 --> 01:12.400
Or if we want to add a two times or three times you can just keep on hitting this plus icon and it will

01:12.400 --> 01:15.230
create some multiple sizes here.

01:15.280 --> 01:20.180
So we have a 2 x 3 x and if we want text appended to the filename.

01:20.320 --> 01:28.600
That's what this is doing here so it's going to say Icahn's chef's hat at 2 x at 3 x so very quickly.

01:28.660 --> 01:33.640
I'm enabling these two to be exported one time to time three times.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.460
And let's go over here.

01:35.710 --> 01:42.010
The same thing we want to make sure that these are named correctly so we can just name this timer name

01:42.010 --> 01:42.650
this hard.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.730
Just really quickly you probably have different naming conventions.

01:46.160 --> 01:52.750
But just make it really simple for your developers to find what they want and you want to do this throughout

01:52.840 --> 01:54.360
all of the designs here.

01:54.370 --> 01:59.970
But let's just use these three so I can select all three of these and come down here I'm going to hit.

01:59.980 --> 02:06.010
Plus it's exploiting those as one time two times three times right here.

02:06.010 --> 02:12.370
So now I don't have to have anything selected because I've preset those to be exportable.

02:12.550 --> 02:18.820
I can click on this export now and it will tell me there's 15 graphics that are going to be exported.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.640
And you see this is one time two times three times.

02:21.820 --> 02:29.510
And this is giving me an error that the origin is not aligned to pixels but we can quickly click export.

02:29.960 --> 02:37.170
I'm going to just export this to my desktop and I'll create a new folder called assets

02:40.100 --> 02:41.540
and hit save.

02:42.050 --> 02:48.560
And now when I go into my assets folder under my desktop when I created these you can see the names

02:48.560 --> 02:55.790
of these comments at 2 x at 3 x and so very easily I can see what these look like.

02:55.790 --> 03:02.090
So this is three times two times in one time they are different sizes and you can pass these off to

03:02.090 --> 03:06.320
your developer to use while they're developing the front end of this design.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.940
Another thing you can do to export assets for your developers is just share this fig file with them

03:11.300 --> 03:13.610
and they don't have to know how to design.

03:13.670 --> 03:18.560
They just have to know how to grab these elements and even Mark some of these elements themselves as

03:18.570 --> 03:20.120
exportable.

03:20.120 --> 03:25.910
So for example if we click on this home on trace here and we go to the code section your developer can

03:25.910 --> 03:31.970
still click on these icons they can name them whatever they want here and they can choose to export

03:31.970 --> 03:37.280
these however they want to export these whatever is going to be the best format for them and they can

03:37.280 --> 03:42.140
export these individually so if they click export button menu for example they can go into the same

03:42.140 --> 03:44.170
folder and click save.

03:44.270 --> 03:48.230
And if we jump back in to here we can see that those are also saved here.

03:48.380 --> 03:51.180
So it's very easy to export these things out.

03:51.200 --> 03:57.710
And in fact once you preset these elements if you ever change them in the future and click to re-export

03:57.740 --> 04:03.860
it'll just overwrite over those existing images and create new fresh versions automatically.
